[Chorus]
Seemed from the start it would end this way
Tell me how it feels to fade away, away from me
I watched you run away from yourself to escape
(Run away from yourself to escape)
And I can't believe a word you say to me, don't say to me
Seemed from the start it would end this way (It would end this far)
Tell me how it feels to fade away, away from me
I watched you run away from yourself to escape
(Run away from yourself to escape)
And I can't believe a word you say to me, don't say to me
