3 Contributorsâ€Žwhat if she already knows everything Lyrics[Verse]
She's fucking around, I'm having visions of it
Feeling chills down my spine, I'm not crying
Don't find me out, I can't find myself
Don't find me out, don't find me out
In her curse, everything feels so painful
She took my heart and left it out on the pavement
In her curse everything feels so painful
My veins keep hurting, I need someone to save meYou might also like1Embed
