3 ContributorsOut of love Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah uh
Woahhhh
Doodoodoodoo
Yeah
(Ayy yo Ian)
Yeah (ok)

[Verse]
Why do you keep comin back over here
Thought I told you twice
Need to get out of my life
I can't fall for one of your tricks again
In my head, this song on repeat (Hey)
I know you're not good for me
(Bad as I want you)

[Chorus]
(Hey)
Yeah, I guess that I'm out of love
You think I fell out of love
Want you to regain my trust but that might be too much
And I fell right on the sidewalk when I fell for your touch
Pretend to not give a fuck
(Bad as I want you)
