3 Contributorsâ€‹not everybody Lyrics[Verse]
Her body fell off the trail
It's almost like something shouldn't mix
I blame it on the town I'm in
Can't even hope for better than this
Everybody's got a somebody
Or at least that's how they're making it seem
Better tell me what you feel pronto 'cause
I feel nothing but the gun in my jeans
Her body fell off the trail
At least that's how they're making it seem
I don't wanna call this bitch
I don't wanna call this bitchYou might also likeEmbed
