Go
Go, yeah , yeah, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You have no heart
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
You know you could do what you want
Baby come get with me
And I need to see you, oh
She said, "What's in that drink?"
Sippin on straight drop
And her favorite color pink
In my cup it get lost
Yeah, go
I'm obsessed with getting higher
Knew from the start that you the one
I might jump on ya, over there
Just to see you how you wouldn't mind
And my heart wouldn't, wouldn't love
If I bring you to my head, there's reasons you [?]

[Chorus]
I don't think anyone can see you
How I see you
You know i wouldn't be feeling how you feeling
I don't think anyone can see you
How I see you
You know i wouldn't be feeling how you feelingYou might also likeEmbed
