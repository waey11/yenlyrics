Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You have no heart

[Verse]
You know you can do what you want
Baby come get with me, yeah
And I need to see you oh
She say "what's in that drink?"
Sippin on straight drop
And her favorite color pink
And my cup it get lost
Yeah, yeah
I’m obsessed with getting higher
Knew from the start that you’re the one
i might jump on ya, over there
Just to see how you wouldn't mind
And my heart wouldn't, wouldn’t love
If I bring you into my head, there's reasons you show [?]
I don’t think anyone can see you, how I see you
Aye
You know I wanna be feeling how you feeling, yuh
(Exclusive)
I don’t think anyone can see you, how I see you
Aye
You know I wanna be feeling how you feeling, yuh
