Cuts on my hands I can't hold yours
I feel stripped of my skin and alone
Tell me what happened to me?
Her face in the pavement
Look what you made me do
Cuts on my hands I can't hold yours (Hold yours)
I feel stripped of my skin and alone (I feel so damn alone)
Tell me what happened to me? (Tell me what happened)
Her face in the pavement (Her face in the)

[Outro]
Look what you made me do (Ahh-ahh)
Look what you made me do (Blame it on the rain outside)
Look what you made me do (Blame it on the cracks on the floor)
Look what you made me do (Blame it on me)
Look what you made me doYou might also likeEmbed
