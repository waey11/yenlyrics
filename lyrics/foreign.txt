Aishi
I'm too high, I'm in the clouds, way-
Aishi
I'm too high, I'm in the clouds-
Ai- aishi

[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm in the clouds
Way too high to let y'all down
Jaydes Christ never sell out
I just need a foreign bitch (You have no heart)
I just need a foreign whip
I won't ever waste my time again
Not with no boring bitch

If you bunny, hit me up
That's just the fundamentals
Where you take it?

She say she want see my drank
Shawty, this is THC
Baby girl, I already smacked
I think she tryna sit with me

I just need a foreign whip
I won't ever waste my time again
