Had to run my money, huh?
Had to run my money up
She hit me up like 1-800 cause she said I'm stunnin'
That nigga said he from the trap but I know he frontin'
Your bitch off a X, now she wait for me to drop a song
Cause she think that I'm next up
With the gang, with Taliban, we gon' give you a check up
When my niggas shoot, they only aim from the neck up

[Bridge]
1-800, hit my line
1-800, hit my line
1-800, hit my line

[Chorus]
Had to run my money, huh?
Had to run my money up
She hit me up like 1-800 cause she said I'm stunnin'
That nigga said he from the trap but I know he frontin'
Your bitch off a X, now she wait for me to drop a song
Cause she think that I'm next up
With the gang, with Taliban, wе gon' give you a check up
When my niggas shoot, thеy only aim from the neck up

[Outro]
1-800, hit my lineYou might also likeEmbed
