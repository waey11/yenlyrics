[Chorus: jaydes]
Niggas be mad cause I'm steppin'
Like Kobe, I'm gon' keep a weapon
Came with a blick, dead lit
He can say "pockets are empty"
I've been making all this guap
I ain't even signed yet
Nigga you down bad, where's your finance?
Say you gon' talk all this shit, but you lyin'
You want the smoke you can find it, yeah

[Verse 1: SoFaygo]
Wipe that lil' boy nose (slatt, yeah)
He gon' fold (yeah)
They know imma blow (bleh)
Gotta get to the bankroll (yeah)
You ain't gang, you can't hang low (yeah)
And I run straight to the pesos (yeah)
Hoe quick, but I made that boy fold (brrihp)
Got a stun, now that lil boy froze
You might also like[Verse 2: jaydes]
(Skrr)
If he run up, he gon' get it
Lil boy gon' regret it, run when he did it
I get a bag nigga yeah my digits
Hop in a [?]
Imma try not to fidget
Louis V round the fit it-
Gone switch the flow
Might fuck your hoe, just cause I can
Might buy some clothes
Say you're a man, but you gon' fold

[Verse 3: SoFaygo]
Came in with that [?] (yeah)
I'm dried out with a pole (bih)
Gettin' my nigga a lit Vlone (yeah)
Why she always calling my phone
Why she always gotta be nosy
I'm thuggin by my lonely
I'm ballin' yeah like Tommy
I'ma shoot the whole place up like Tommy
[Chorus: jaydes]
Niggas be mad cause I'm steppin'
Like Kobe, I gon' keep a weapon
Came with a blick, dead lit
He can say "pockets are empty"
I've been making all this guap
I ain't even signed yet
Nigga you down bad, where's your finance?
Say you gon' talk all this shit, but you lyin'
You want the smoke you can find it, yeahEmbed
