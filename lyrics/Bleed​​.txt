3 ContributorsBleed​​ Lyrics[Chorus]
(You have no heart!)
Yeah, down like 500 mgs (Hoodrich)
Say its cold like 5 degrees
She take percs to cheer her up
That bitch take like 5 a week
Since a jit, ain't give a fuck
Franco jugged a pound of weed
He just trappin' 'til he up

[Verse]
Might go to LA just to leave
She scared that I'm not waking up
I smoked too much, now I can't breathe
At least there's nothing in my cup
She love me but I'm out of reach
She love me but I'm MIA
Like ho, I'm tryin, watch me bleed
Watch my family move wit this power

[Verse]
Who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Another bag, I'll hold this tight
Cuz losing you, it made me bank
Said "Jaydes, like why the fuck you bored?"
What da fuck I'm 'posed to say?
She hate when I'm MIA
Barely postin on my page
My phone carries all my sins
So I been screamin fuck the fame
You might also like[Chorus]
(You have no heart!)
Yeah, down like 500 mgs
Say its cold like 5 degrees
She take percs to cheer her up
That bitch take like 5 a week
Since a jit, ain't give a fuck
Franco jugged a pound of weed
He just trappin' 'til he up

[Verse]
Might go to LA just to leave
She scared that I'm not waking up
I smoked too much, now I can't breathe
At least there's nothing in my cup
She love me but I'm out of reach
She love me but I'm MIA
Like ho, I'm tryin, watch me bleed
Watch my family move wit this power

[Verse]
Who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me (yeah)Embed
