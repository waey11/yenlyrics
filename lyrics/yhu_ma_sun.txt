[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinkin' I fell in love with the penicillin
Bitch, I'm mixin' up Fanta, Codeine, and Hennessy
Killin' myself is my only pleasant feelin'
They been sayin' that I'm selfish with no heart or feelings
They been sayin' that I'm selfish with no heart or feelings
(You have no heart)
It's Yen that we wheeling, currency my ceiling
Off these 30's I been nodding out for a minute

Make that lil boy spin, this choppa, made him touch his limit
These boys broke, they on the block, they know they pockets midget
I see niggas try bite the swag, I let them fumble with it
I said, "Gimme that and that lil bitch, I'm juggin' your shit"
Bitch, I'm juggin' your shit, yeah
Bitch, I'm juggin' your shit, yeah
He said he like Draco's, so we drillin' his shit (yeah)
Yeah, we killin' his jit, yeah
Yeah, we killin' his bitch, yeah (blah)
Yeah, homicide
(You have no heart)
(You have no heart)
(Homicide, homicide, homicide)
