Fuck-
(You have no heart)

[Verse]
I'm really still dolo
Rather do it solo
She said that she love me
But I know that she lie good and know that she a no go
Tell her what she wanted now she barely keep her clothes on
Too bad it get slimey, now her friends know what go on (Yeah)
I guess I'm stuck in my ways
Cause me and you just don't feel the same
(Me and you just don't feel the same no more)
Me and you just don't feel the same
Me and you just don't feel the same no more (Yeah)
Convince you that I'm not
But it is what it is
Thought about you on the stage
In a city full of a rage
With some puddles full of what?
You don't love it when it rains
She tries to hold her breath until somebody come saves herYou might also likeEmbed
