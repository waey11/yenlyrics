[Verse]
Yeah, passive on my phone, and on my dick, bitch I can′t take it
If you never really liked me, why the fuck would you keep fakin'?
It′s not fair to put it on me, 'cause now you wasting all my time
It's whatever, yeah I′m chillin, I′m coolin', I′m, (evvls)
I can't sleep the same
Knowing that you′re toying with my brain
Nah fuck that shit
I can't sleep the same
Knowing that you′re fucking toying with my brain
I don't wanna hear your stories, they're all the same

[Part II]

[Intro]
You have no heart!
Yo Silo, you killed this

[Verse]
Hey, hey, woah
Woah, yeah
I do what I wanna, (I do what I wanna)
I don′t know what friends for the drama
Still in love with her, talking ′bout her to my momma
N***as wanna put her up, when they see a dolla
These bitches wanna put her up, when they see some commas
They not you, they know that

[Verse]
Find out, how to make you mine
I'ma find out, how to make you mine
I′ma find out, how to make you mine
I miss your love for me
I miss your company
The way that this shit panned out, this shit dubbin me
And I'm not showing no expression, like it′s nothing to me
When I swear you the only one that matters
Like damn, at least my pockets getting fatter
And now, my hoes ask me, "baby what's the matter?"
You not her
Like fuck man, it′s too much on my platter
She was everything I wanted, and I had herEmbed
