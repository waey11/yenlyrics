8 Contributors​paranoia Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah (You have no heart)
Yeah, yeah
Broke my own heart, I split my shit into two
Yeah, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, guess I broke my own heart, I split my shit into two (Split my shit into two)
I should of known from the start that pretty ho's always rude (Pretty ho's)
All these cameras get me paranoid, still thinkin' 'bout you
I'm still thinkin' 'bout you, I'm still thinking 'bout you (I'm still thinking 'bout you)
Broke my own heart, I split my shit into two (Split my shit into two)
I should of known from the start that pretty ho's always rude (Pretty ho's)
All these cameras get me paranoid, still thinkin 'bout you
I'm still thinkin' 'bout you, I'm still thinking 'bout you (I'm still thinking 'bout you)

[Verse]
I smoke till I cannot breathe (I smoke till I cannot breathe)
These ho's think that they finеssin' for a wedding ring (They finessin' for a wеdding ring)
Jaydes been MIA, like where he at? He left the scene, yeah (He left the scene, yeah)
Pretty ho gon' fall in love when she hear me sing (When she hear me sing, she gon' call my—)

(You have no heart)
Yo, what's the word? (Hey)
Heard I'm movin' different tell me what you heard?
Baby, tell me what you heard?
Fast life got me rollin' but them cameras irk my nerves
I said “I love it when it rains and love my hoes” and she said “Purr, boo”
Told her roll with me, because her boyfriend is a herb, boo
I stay off my phone so you should slide so I can learn you (So I can learn you)
Maybe, I want her and I want her too (Yeah, yeah)
I get what I want, that's just 'til I don't though
Nobody relate, that's why I can’t trust a soul, bro
I don’t miss the old me, now I shop at SoHo
Niggas think they know me, I promise they don't though
Thinkin' 'bout you, I’m still thinking 'bout you, yeah (Ha-ha)
(You have no heart)Embed
