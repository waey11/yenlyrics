2 Contributors​not enough Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
(You have no heart)

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Bad bitches come my way
These bitches see me, they wanna play
And I might put that B.B on her waist
Can't give out freebies, don't go on dates
Came to the show and she seen my face
She was a hoe when she mentioned my plays
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I live by the jugg and I die by the jugg
If you is a thug, then show me wassup
Took 500mg, shit not enough
They said "Jaydes, why you empty?"
I sold my soul
Ima pull up to M.D just for the show
Ima be up in N.Y in a few weeks
Maybe Ima spеnd time wit' my hoes
You might also like[Verse 1]
All of thesе bitches, they think
I put a A.P in a sink
I got a chop and it came wit' a beam
I'm paid off of streams nigga, count it up
Won't stock and clean, bitch I don't give a fuck
She got a man, how she shakin' her butt though?
If you not gang then don't say "wassup?"
You not the gang, nigga pull out the cut throat

[Verse 2]
Pull out one hunnid round drums
Nigga wassup?
You in the wrong hood, nigga you dumb
All of my niggas in love wit' 'em guns
Too bad I fell in love with bussing juggs (juggs)
If I'm in the trap, yo' bitch in the trap
She shakin' her ass, I'm getting my bag
These niggas outside, the venue real packed
I'm getting my racks, okay

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Bad bitches come my way
These bitches see me, they wanna play
And I might put that B.B on her waist
Can't give out freebies, don't go on dates
Came to the show and she seen my face
She was a hoe when she mentioned my plays
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I live by the jugg and I die by the jugg
If you is a thug, then show me wassup
Took 500mg, shit not enough
They said "Jaydes, why you empty?"
I sold my soul
Ima pull up to M.D just for the show
Ima be up in N.Y in a few weeks
Maybe Ima spend time wit' my hoesEmbed
