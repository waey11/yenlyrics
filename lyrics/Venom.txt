1 ContributorVenom Lyrics[Verse]
And my main bitch, off sativa (Off sativa)
Walk up in Chanel, I smell like reefa' (Smell like reefa')
Beat that pussy, take her soul, she want a refund (Refund)
I put the stack up in her mask, can't let them see nun'
I just left the bank, wit' some' day ones
Too high, flyin', I think my Backwood sayin' some'
I think she wan' be famous, that bitch finna hang for me
That lil' bitch gon' say she love me, but she won't hit no stain for me
Backwood gon' go on that lake, I'ma just call that tidal-wave
Ooh girl, please stay out the way
You just know we not the same
Know I hate that jealous shit, everything feel venomous
She say, "Everything feel venomous"You might also likeEmbed
