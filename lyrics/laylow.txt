Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmberofthefall
Go, go, aye, yeah, aye, what?
Oh yeah, ooh

[Verse]
Rushin' that boy, when I say so
We gon' give that boy, a halo (Shh, shh)
Put a ski on, it was case closed
Told you, "I don't fuck with dem' lame ho's"
My bitch show love, and she lay low (Wha-)
Can't fuck, wit' a complainin' ho'
Put a switch on a beam
'Cause, pussy-ass nigga love flamin'
Pussy-ass nigga, gon' flame 'nem (Shoot)
I'm too bool, gotta lay low
2 ho's wit' me, got tangled
2 straps wit' me, I stay calm
Rap nigga, love my name, or some?
Lil nigga's must be gay, or some
Why would I switch on a day ones?
Really thought I heard you sayin' some
I guess they my bruddas
Lame ass bitch, I dubbed hеr (Blatt)
Lame ass bitch, I dubbed her
Why would I еver cuff that?
Why would I ever cuff that?
Bloodbath's wit' me, we slimed up
Goyard bag, keep my hand on that
OG to the sun, we takin' stacks
Yeah, (Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, aye, yeah, oh)

[Outro]
Yeah, want free-want free smoke, then pushup
You want smoke? I'm in that pushup
You want smoke? Pussy boy, lookup
Yeah, heavyweight, swervin'
I can't lie, this bitch was slurpin'
Pussy ass nigga, you ain't got no purpose
I just wake up and count these earnings
I just wake up and pour that purp-purp
Bad lil thot speakin' to me in Spanish
I'm off the xan, I'm 'bout to vanishEmbed
