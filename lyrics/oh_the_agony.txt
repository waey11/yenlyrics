[Verse]
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging 
I feel theres nothing for me here and I’m trying to get out

[Chorus]
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I fell into your void, a feeling I cant shake
Do you want me okay?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?

[Verse]
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging 
I feel theres nothing for me here and I’m trying to get out

[Chorus]
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?

[Verse]
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging 
I feel theres nothing for me here and I’m trying to get out

[Chorus]
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
