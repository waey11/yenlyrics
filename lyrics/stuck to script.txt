[Verse]
I got my money, keep up with me, bitch
This shit not love, you not stuck with me, bitch
I'm tired of gettin' ego'd by some niggas I'm better than, watch how you fuck with me, bitch
You got some money, but you not rich
You copped some jeans, you movin' stiff
You had a girl, I stole that bitch
You had some spotlight, I stole that shit
You was gon' run up, you folded quick
You feelin' threatened, you told him quick
That's not your weapon, you holdin' it
That's not your bestie, I gave him a follow back because he told me right where you live
I could keep going but I had enough
Exotic bitches gave head on the tour bus, get to the hotel they tryna fu—
