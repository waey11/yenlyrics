Nigga you so lame, why the fuck you copy mop? (evvls, bitch)
Nigga, I'm not playing games
You keep talking, you get robbed
Niggas talking hella crazy, but at night time, they get robbed
All these bitches wanna fame me, but they gonna catch this Glock
Yeah, yeah, (evil)
They gonna get popped, they finna get shot up
She finna get blacked
Like that fire, keep that crack
Feel like Autumn!, keep that blatt
Took your Glock, you took it back
Shut the fuck up, your music as—

[Verse: zatru]
I don't know how to express my emotions
Talkin' down on gang, leave his body in the ocean
You a lame, boy I heard you begging for them opens
This ain't Fortnite, fuck him up, he need a potion
I know I messed up, but there's no going back, so I guess I'm out of luck
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Terrorists win

[Outro: zatru]
I don't know how to express my emotions
Talkin' down on gang, leave his body in the ocean
You a lame, boy I heard you begging for them opens
This ain't Fortnite, fuck him up, he need a potionYou might also likeEmbed
