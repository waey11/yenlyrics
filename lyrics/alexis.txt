[Intro]
(You have no heart)
It's been fuck them for a long time, my fans know
Her room smell like Burberry, she scared that her man know
Flexed up, icy, I do what I can hoe, I do what I want to
Bad bitch named Alexis moving xans she can get u right
954, don't need yo advance
My budget not tight like try again
Trap until we can't
These college groupies wanna spend the night
I love getting bands I should get that printed on a shirt
Niggas moving funny
Niggas moving weird, bro ima worry bout my money
Niggas doing extra, but cant hold nothin above me
Jaydes' a skinny nigga, but them pockets lookin chubby
[Outro]
