2 ContributorsAlexis Lyrics[Verse]
(You have no heart)
It's been fuck them for a long time, my fans know
Her arms smell like Burberry, she scared that her man know
Flexed up, icy (Ai-Aishi)
I do what I can, ho
I do what I want to
Bad bitch named Alexis moving Xans, she can get you right
Nap at four
Don’t need your advance, my budget not tight, like try again
Trappin till we can't, these college groupies wanna spend the night
I love gettin bands, I should get that printed on a shirt
Niggas movin funny
Niggas movin weird, but Ima worry bout my money
Niggas doin extra but can't hold nothin above me
Jaydes a skinny nigga, but them pockets lookin chubby
