3 ContributorsWalk Lyrics[Intro]
You have no heart
Yeah, huh, yeah
I walk in that bitch and they know that I'm him (huh)
I walk in that bitch and they know that-
Walk in (huh)
I walk in that (huh)
I walk in that-
Yeah

[Chorus]
I walk in that bitch and they know that I'm him
Can't take that designer off of my skin
He talking crazy his shooter got hit
I swear to God we not going for shit
I swear to God that I stole your bitch
I swear to God we gon' jugg your mans
Really spent ten bands on this fit
Even the cashier said "Damn,"

[Verse]
Don't give one fuck about whatever he say, huh
Miami hoes want a three-way, huh
Mask on like I was Ceeday, huh
Choppa gon' give him a BD present
She said Jay looking like BK, huh
Niggas gon' die, you can call that shit D-Day
Been MIA for like three days, huh
(I really don't fuck with these people)
Need like two bands for a feat, huh
I stole that bitch, feel like Pete
Too bad you nothing like Kanye
I stole his bitch and that nigga ain't peep
Spent half a band on a tee (on God)
Swear that my closet is archive
Shoutout Tana, shoutout my boy T
Me and my shooters gon' give you a hard time
You might also like[Chorus]
Walk in that bitch and they know that I'm him
Can't take that designer off of my skin
He talking crazy his shooter got hit
I swear to God we not going for shit
I swear to God that I stole your bitch
I swear to God we gon' jugg your mans
Really spent ten bands on this fit
Even the cashier said-
Yeah (damn)

[Outro]
Really spent ten bands on this fit
Even the cashier said "Damn,"
I walk in that bitch and they know that I'm him (yeah, damn)
Miami hoes want a three-way, huhEmbed
