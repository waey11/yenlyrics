[Chorus] 
Walk past me you gon get second hand
Make 20 bands for 100 seconds man
Keep lil shawty round me cause she pressure
Thought you knew bout me like damn 
Thats yo nigga but you didnt have a man
Stacks on my head i demand
Pussy nigga you can turn into a fan
She wanna watch how i count my bands
So i tell lil hoe count my bands
Baby to pretty, She try fuckin’ with me she fell in a trance
My lil bro so dizzy,  these niggas so diddy i cant do no friends
My lil bro so dizzy,  these niggas so diddy i cant do no friends

[Verse]
10 bands in
10 bands out
I only trust my bankroll
My lil shawty, way out west, helpin me serve out the  yayo
Bad lil thottie
She in the party
She suck me up til i say so (Like sayso)
She tryna act like she not gon break my heart
Cant cool with no fake hoe
I miss my lil flame
Put the actavis in the faygo

[Chorus] 
Walk past me you gon get second hand
Make 20 bands for 100 seconds man
Keep lil shawty round me cause she pressure
Thought you knew bout me like damn 
Thats yo nigga but you didnt have a man
Stacks on my head i demand
Pussy nigga you can turn into a fan
She wanna watch how i count my bands
So i tell lil hoe count my bands
Baby to pretty, She try fuckin’ with me she fell in a trance
My lil bro so dizzy,  these niggas so diddy i cant do no friends
My lil bro so dizzy,  these niggas so diddy i cant do no friends
