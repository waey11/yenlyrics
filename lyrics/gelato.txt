Yeah
Really do this shit on auto, booted off Gelato
Really do this shit on auto, booted off Gelato

[Chorus]
Really do this shit on auto, booted off Gelato (You have no heart)
Green laser on the Glock, lil' nigga clutchin' a Palo
Green pockets full of guap
I need my money, not your problems
I walk in the function and these lil' niggas followin' me
White girl in the back doin' coke, Demi Levato, she hate when I call her that
Young jaydes too locked in
Niggas wanna pull me out, told the opps, "Suck my dick"
Still left with a frown though 'cause I can't even trust my clique
I know she gon' let me down, but I'm still gеtting high with this bitch
(I know she gon' let me down)

[Chorus]
Rеally do this shit on auto, booted off Gelato
Green laser on the Glock, lil' nigga clutchin' a Palo
Green pockets full of guap
I need my money, not your problems
I walk in the function and these lil' niggas followin' me
White girl in the back doin' coke, Demi Levato, she hate when I call her that
Young jaydes too locked in
Niggas wanna pull me out, told the opps, "Suck my dick"
Still left with a frown though 'cause I can't even trust my clique
I know she gon' let me down, but I'm still getting high with this bitch
(I know she gon' let me down)
