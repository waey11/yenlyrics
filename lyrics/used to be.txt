Huh, I used be in the trap, now I'm out
My ni**as smokin’ your pack, boy chill out
I think I'm the man of the time right now
Ni**as try stealing my swag right now
Her ni**a look like a clown right now
She want the lean, she stay with the weed
She want a new mean coat
Kick that bitch out cause that bitch is a treesh hoe
How you gon hate when you asked for a feat?
Walk in that bitch with a raf on my jeans
Shawty on me, on my dick, she a fein
Bitches want me for the muhfuckin' green
You talkin’ crazy, we shoot out this beam
[?] that bitch got a beam
Bitch on my DM's, she beggin' for me, huh

[Verse]
A ni**a been chattin' online, uh

If it's your bitch tell me [?]
If you not a bitch then comе outside
You think you hoeing, ni**a that is cap
You think you rich, ni**a thats a lie

[Chorus]
Huh, I usеd be in the trap, now I'm out
