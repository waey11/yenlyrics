Burn that hoe, my lil thot
She's so cold, she's so blue
She's so bad cut, can't come from
There's blood red, a new blood red
Light up and go run around
She run her mouth, she never stop
She sending voicemails through my phone
She wanna go, but she can't go

[Chorus]
But she can't go, girl
Girl, I'm tappin your window, will you let me in
It felt like losing control, you so damn hurt love within
You don't know where your going, but i know where ur going
The darkness get lonely, that's why you gotta stay with me

[Chorus]
But she can't go, girl
Girl, I'm tapping your window, will you let me in
It felt like losing control, you so damn hurt lovе within
You don't know where your going, but i know wherе ur going
The darkness get lonely, that's why you gotta stay with meYou might also likeEmbed
