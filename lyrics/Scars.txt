4 ContributorsScars Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, aye
Yuh, hold up aye
Huh yeah
Aye yuh, woah aye woah aye
(You have no heart)

[Verse]
I ride round with some bills on me
I ride round off these pills
I'm in the cut I'm tryna feel something
It feel like I got some scars that won't heal
When you told me that you loved me, was it real?
I got history, I can't even take you serious
Too much on my mind don't get no sleep boy I'm delirious
It's some hoes that think they special when they hearing this
Oh, don't worry about me
It's a lot of fuck niggas that wanna see me bleed
You try to run up on me get put up onna tee
Xan on my tongue, and I'm running up thе green
Yuh, aye yuh
Pussy nigga switch up, I ain't with that shit, yuh
I would never snitch, causе I was hitting licks
Yea, told her "Baby say my name when I'm hitting it"
Just got me some ice for my fangs now I'm really lit
Boy that's not no ice, aye yo chain from the mall
Aye, Jaydeschrist I'm the sickest of them all
I was MIA for a game but I still ball nigga
Lil bro hating i'm the one that put you on boy
I find that shit amazing
Dick down your shawty, boy
I ain't even playing
Been known you is a batty boy
Hoes been saying (been saying)You might also likeEmbed
