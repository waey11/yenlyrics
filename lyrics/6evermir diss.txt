[Intro]
(I'ma start off with some slung shit)
(You have no heart!)

[Chorus]
Niggas getting broker everyday, yeah
Check his ig posts, he don't show face, yeah
Hide behind them dreads, bitch, we know you depressed, bitch
Can't handle the pressure, get that boy a Nesquik
Niggas getting broker everyday, yeah
Check his ig posts, he don't show face, yeah
Hide behind them dreads, bitch, we know you depressеd, bitch
Can't handle the pressurе, get that boy a Nesquik

[Verse]
Nigga got a neckbeard like he in his 30's
Man not getting bitches 'cause his dreads are too dirty
Nigga got his skinny jeans, can't keep walkin'
Why this nigga keep dropping?
All them bitches keep floppin'

[Part II]

Yo what the fuck is this?
This nigga sounds like a shitty sgpwes, bro
Turn this shit off, nigga

Don't go for my money, I say that shit
Stupid ass diss, don't save that bitch
Tell you can't dress, by looking at your fit
Tell you can't [?], by looking at your wrist

Nigga this day yo biggest fear
I heard yo shit, it's so ass that I damn near shed a tear
You a lil' fanboy, you a queer
Nigga this day yo biggest fear
I heard yo shit, it's so ass that I damn near shed a tearEmbed
