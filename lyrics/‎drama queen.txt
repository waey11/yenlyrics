(You have no heart, you have no—, you have no heart)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Do you even know I think about you?
Too much pride, bae, I gotta take it out you (Out you)
Too damn high to call you back, I swear I was about to (Was about to)
Keep your co-sign rapper, keep the clout too
Keep that co-sign, boy, this not about you (It's not about you)
Bad bitch, twelve o’clock, keep this room sixty degrees
Pops said put it in investments, gang say put it into weed (Gang say put it into weed)
They know that I'm not no ho but love my hoes, but that's just me

[Verse]
How the fuck you number one if I’m alive?
How the fuck you said you love me, but don't care? You fuckin' lied
Why you getting jealous of these trial hoes? I'm fuckin' tired (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honeybеrry Backwood on this blunt, bro, I'm so fuckin' fried (Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah, way too fuckin' fried)
Every word is true ’cause I got tired of the cap, huh
Bae, keep my attention ’cause I'm tired of the basic
Used to be my high when I got tired of the rap, huh
It’s a lot of love lost, feelin' like you faked it
Balenciaga, callin' my designer ASICS
Bitch, I'm not gon’ text you if you actin' like you hate it
Love me and you hate me, but you love the way I say it
I'm to myself, these niggas fake, like take your places
You might also like[Chorus]
Do you even know I think about you?
Too much pride, bae, I gotta take it out you
Too damn high to call you back, I swear I was about to
Keep your co-sign rapper, keep the clout too
Keep that co-sign, boy, this not about you (It's not about you)
Bad bitch, twelve o'clock, keep this room sixty degrees
Pops said put it in investments, gang say put it into weedThey know that I'm not no ho but love my hoes, but that's just me

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, I'm like, yeah-eah
Oh, yeah, I'm like, yeah, yeahEmbed
