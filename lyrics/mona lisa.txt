[Intro]
Hazard, you dangerous
Aye, where tf witty?
You have no heart

[Verse]
If I trust you, are you gonna cross me?
I been off these drugs boo, I be movin' top speed
I feel all the lust too, comin' for the money
Yeah, if you really love me you would call me
Way too many options, sometimes wish they wasn't on me
I just copped a zip, it got me movin' like a zombie
He gon' call me pussy, but his bitch gon' call me papi
She like, "Jaydes, you feeling straight?" But, my own voice is talkin' to me

[Chorus]
I'ma be okay
I'm up in the studio, lil bitch don't call me bae
I just copped a zip and then I flip that shit to X
Mona Lisa on the phone, she say "Bae, I'm on the way"
And don't feel bad for meYou might also likeEmbed
