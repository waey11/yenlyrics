Hoe, I did this shit for you
Your pussy better, can't even lie
I just mixed Arc’teryx with NUMBER (N)INE
Yeah, what it is
It's hit that shit two times
Aka og dutch man
Aka lil pink skully
Aka young phat
And you now rocking with DJ Phat nigga

[Verse 1]
Can't even lie
I’m trippin on xans
Need a new crib to show whats good
Gucci dove fly money get so high
Shawty feelin' on me
Tryna smoke my wood
If you my opp go delete yourself
Sometimes I wanna delete myself
Scars on my wrist I put Benjamins on them
I needed you but i believed in my self
Snakes in my boot been this way since a kid
I can't even hide my influencing
Boots on me thumpin' right through that shit
I might just buy that lil bitch a bag
Bitches gotta act right through this shit
Pussy biting on who he coolin' with
What yuke say, can't fuck with people
I'm getting tired of free dough huh (I love DJ Phat!)

Your pussy better, can’t even lie
