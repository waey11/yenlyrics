3 ContributorsBetrayal LyricsI need my money that's all
I get my money, I'm gone
Rather do this shit myself
Maybe that's just what I'm on
Maybe I'm feeling betrayed
I'm the only one I trust
My money still up, all these niggas still suck
Way to high, had young nigga stuck
Keep a lil switch, incase a nigga act dumb
Really, just me and my blood
I'm the only one that I trust
I'm the only one that I trust
I'm the only one that I trust
I really cannot fuck with you
After you what did
Put that shit under my skin
Everything that we had left went to shitYou might also likeEmbed
