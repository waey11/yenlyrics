1 Contributor‎old sad stuff, blame Lyrics[Intro]
Cuts on my hands, I can't hold yours
I feel stripped of my skin and alone
Tell me, what happened to me?
My face in the pavement, look what you made me do

[Verse]
Cuts on my hands, I can't hold yours
I feel stripped of my skin and alone
Tell me, what happened to me?
My face in the pavement, look what you made me do

[Outro]
Look what you made me do (Blame it on the rain outside)
Look what you made me do (Blame it on the cracks on the floor)
Look what you made me do (Blame it on me, blame it on me)
Look what you madе me do (Blame it on me)You might also likeEmbed
