Ha, always keep that semi, bitch I never lack
Talkin' 'bout the ho's, bitch I got plenty, bitch I'm always stacked
Down bad on your dick and I got Fendi with like hella racks
Pockets just like Cleveland Brown, both them bitches always fat
I'm not finna lie, both of my hands really tied down
All these bitches want me, it don't matter 'bout they type now
27, I just signed a paper and I signed out
She said that she never really want me, we gon' find out

[Bridge]
Da da da da da da da da
Y-y-y-you have no—
