[Intro]
Yuh, yuh
Goth Season

[Verse]
Yeah, thank you for supporting me 
If you love me then I love you
Beside these drugs I've got nothing to do
Beside these drugs I've got nothing to do
Besides yourself, you've got nothing to lose
Just like my pint, I put in orange juice
Throw my 4's up, cause I rose up
I'm speeding, Forza
[?]
Diamond blunts, rolled up, curled up, girl fuck
In the corner, curled up
No love, no trust, no fucks
Can ya, have it, dat lust, in heaven
In heaven, ain't no us
Gucci dove, fly away, to the stars
Gucci dove, flying
Goth tears, tears on the blunt

[Outro]
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
Just go away
Just go away
Just fly away
I'm the Yaphomet, the [?] ... fucking [?]

All these tears in my Fanta, run lil girl you know you want my heart
All these tears in my Fanta, run you know you want my heart
