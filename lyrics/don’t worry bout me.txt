8 Contributors​don’t worry bout me Lyrics[Intro]
(You have—)
Hold on, huh
Pew, pew (Okay), huh, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Like ooh, ooh, ooh
Like yeah, yeah, yeah (Pew, pew)

[Chorus]
I'm getting money, lil' dude, don't worry 'bout me (Don't worry 'bout me)
Yeah, I'll take your bitch in a jiffy, I don't need no words, on my feet (Don't need no words on my feet)
But I got some words on my feet, huh
Balenciaga when I step on the street, Bottega sometimes, really depends
Them Ramones overdid like a treesh
I spend way too much on gas but I guess it's investing
I got rich and you stayed broke, wasn't that depressing?
I spent too much on that ho, that shit got pretty messy though
You said you wasn't gon' miss me but look like you stressin' ho, okay

[Verse]
Had to do it myself 'cause nobody else could keep up (Nobody else could keep up)
You want your bitch back, I don't care, you can keep her (Ha-ha)
There's finer on me, Cartier diamonds on me and she dyin' to see
I'm sorry I missed your text
You think I'm lyin', lil' bitch, I've been, tryna breath
Don't give a fuck 'bout your title but I love all my hoes pretty and entitled
I stay to myself, said I'm going up, lil' bitch, I've been here for a while
His bitch heart pacing like Usain Bolt when he runnin' a mile, yeah
(Yeah-eah-eah)
