I think she's my type
I need her number, stuck up in my mind
Small waist, she's so fine
Tell her, "Hit my line"
Tell her, "Come over," I won't waste your time, yeah
I think she's my type
I need her number, stuck up in my mind
Small waist, she's so fine
Tell her, "Hit my line"
Tell her, "Come over," I won't waste your time, yeah

[Verse]
Let me treat you right, yeah
You way too pretty for you just to stay a night, yeah
Made me focus on my bands, I'm tryna get right with you
Even though I'm off thе drugs, I wanna feel time with you
(The last time you gonna see a bad guy likе this—)
This a soft song, but I'll still pop a nigga (Pop that nigga)
Born in '06, but I still rock that nigga (Rock that nigga)
Old friends be acting like some goofies, had to drop them niggas
Talkin' crazy on the game, they robbed the nigga (Robbed that nigga)
He got jugged

[Chorus]
I think she's my type
I need her number, stuck up in my mind
Small waist, she's so fine
Tell her, "Hit my line"
Tell her, "Come over," I won't waste your time, yeah
I think she's my type
I need her number, stuck up in my mind
Small waist, she's so fine
Tell her, "Hit my line"
Tell her, "Come over," I won't waste your time

The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this
Let me tell youEmbed
