1 ContributorGirls a liar Lyrics[Intro]
Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
You don't want no strings attached, girl, I'll give you what you need
If you don't do that love shit baby, get up on your knees
I don't wanna argue, you could check yo shit on me

[Verse]
You say that I'm lying, girl, I don't know what you need
But, it takes one to know one, girl your crying's not enough
Under the impression that what we had was real love
I been a side nigga too, I think I've seen enough

[Chorus]
Yeah, these hoes be lyin (these hoes be lyin)
These hoes be lyin (these hoes be lyin)
These hoes be lyin (these hoes be lyin)
