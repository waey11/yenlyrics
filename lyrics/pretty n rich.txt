Yeah, saying my brodie changed? You on that bullshit

Add up, and then gabby, I might buy her some more, Rick
Oh he wanted flicks? 'Cause I′m pretty, and I’m rich

[Verse]
Ha, I could pull yo mommy, if I wanted to
Need that purple, and that red, I don't wanna choose
Always lurking in the dark, ′cause I dont wanna lose
Off them perky′s and that molly, she see molecules
Niggas forget, I was evvl, I could turn that bitch back on

Yeah, saying my brodie changed? You on that bullshit
Yeah, only thing you finessing is this full clip, blick
Add up, and then gabby, I might buy her some more, Rick
