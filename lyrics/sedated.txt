7 Contributors​sedated Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty ho gon' ask me if I’m famous (Okay)
Gas got me sedated, put my blunt out on the pavement (Pavement)
She said she in love, I fell in love with my hiatuses
Julie think I'm conceded but askin' what the latest been (Askin’ what the latest been)
I don't know, just chasing it, huh

[Chorus]
I really need me a bad bitch, um, pretty with similar habits, um
Sex, money, drugs, you can have it, um
She need to know she a bad bitch, yeah
I really need me a bad bitch, um, pretty with similar habits, um
Sex, money, drugs, you can have it, um
She need to know shе a bad bitch

[Verse]
I'm getting high 'cause I need to be up
Shе got a man, but still hittin' me up
She off the Henny, she want a new cup
She seen my status, now she wanna fuck
Try to convince me that you not a dub
Maybe if you come through, I'll see what's true and see what's up
