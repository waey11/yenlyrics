[Intro]
(You have no heart)
Bleh

[Verse]
Yeah,
Yea drank got me nauseous
Listen to me throw up
Left me here unconscious
But I'm like, she ain't show up
I answer to no one
I really got no one
I look like I'm no one
My fist lookin' froze yuh
You killing me slowly
Drowning in the low end
Drowning in that codeine
That nigga scared for you to know me
You don't talk about the past for reasons
I'm only off the xan when I'm fienin
You won't- You won't understand what I'm feeling
It's the way you made me feel i need it

[Outro]
(My day was good)
