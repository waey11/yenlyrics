1 Contributor;( Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart)
Yeah

[Verse]
Drank got me nauseous
Listen to me throw up
Left me here unconscious
I'm like, she ain't show up
I answer to noone
I really got noone
I look like I'm noone
My wrist lookin' frozen
You killing me slowly
Drowning in the low end
Drowning in that codeine
That nigga scared, for you to know me
You don't talk about the past for a reason
I'm only off the xan when I'm feenin
You won't understand what I'm feeling
It's the way you made me feel i need it

[Outro]
