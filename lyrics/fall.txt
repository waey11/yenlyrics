1 Contributor​fall Lyrics[Intro]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no
(I love you evvls)

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna fall apart, not at all
Man the thoughts don’t stop, cause the bullshit don’t add up no more
And I’m tired of knocking on doors, (Nah, yuh)

[Verse]
Baby you can fall with me
Do it all with me
I had plans with you but I guess we couldn’t meet 'em
Cause it’s over now
I'm barely sober now
But now I see
I don’t know how to feel so i'ma sing
Baby you an angel, you cut off your own wings
Trying but the pressure is getting to me
I was under the impression that we were in sync
But I guess that I was wrong
I guess that we gonna fall
But I guess it was my fault
Yeah I guess it was my fault
I don’t wanna fall
I don’t wanna fall
I don’t wanna fall
I don’t wannaYou might also likeEmbed
