7 Contributors‎entry two LyricsToo many thoughts up in my head
Swear no one understands
But there's no one that will listen
Now you seen the cause and it fled to my skin

Nervous, hate feeling like this, huh
People saying this is a phase, haha
15, but do I know that? Oh do you?
Can't rid the expression off my face
My friend tried to tell me that it's okay
My wrist tells me that it's all my fault
Might call my friends a dickhead, egotistical, act like they know it all

And you don't know enough
I just want to fade away
Sometimes feels like this life is a game, I don't wanna play
