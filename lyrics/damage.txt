10 Contributors​damage Lyrics[Intro]
I’m deleting the app
Yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby sippin' Hennessy and poppin' Xans (Poppin' Xans)
Yeah you different, you from a different planet (Trap, baby girl you different for real)
Sent you back and left, I undid the damage
She walked down I said "I love it where her hand has been" (You have no heart)
Anytime you cross my mind when I landed (Cross my mind when I landed)
My money dance, I'm getting bread like I planned it
Still alone on the stage likе I'm doing stand-up
I'm so high, pass the blunt to God

[Verse]
Bad ho, take advantage of my monеy
Put me on Hulu or something
Gucci bag when I walk in the function
Gucci watch but need a Patek, I'm bugging (Gucci watch, yeah, yeah) (lyric)

[Chorus]
Baby sippin' Hennessy and poppin' Xans (Yeah, poppin' Xans)
Yeah you different, you from a different planet (Baby girl you different for real)
Sent you back and left, I undid the damage
She walked down I said "I love it where her hand has been" (Where it has been)
Anytime you cross my mind when I landed (Cross my mind when I landed)
My money dance, I'm getting bread like I planned it
Still alone on the stage like I'm doing stand-up
You might also like[Outro]
I'm so high, pass the blunt to God
Ball like MJ, just pass me the rock
Traeh ruoy ot yek eht dna
