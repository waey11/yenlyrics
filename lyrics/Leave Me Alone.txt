5 ContributorsLeave Me Alone Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart)
Ooh, hey
(You have no hea-)
(You have no heart)

[Verse 1]
This ho tryna play with my heart, act like I don't see that shit
Huh, all of these niggas is fake, I already peeped that shit
Rap ass nigga too corny, my own damn lane what i be in
Bougie bitch roll up my wood, put this hoe to work, no Tisakorean

[Chorus]
Huh, just leave me alone, just leave me alone, just leave me alone
Cross on my neck bitch I feel like a pope
She tryna finesse, play herself like a ho
She tryna be mad, but stuck in my posts
But when we not talking you jealous of hoes
You doing too much, just leave me alone
Just leave me alone, just leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ooh, you not my twin stop calling me that
Spoke all this shit into happening
I did this myself, like where was you at
Three five in this wood, bitch I'm rolling fat
If I'm in your city, you know where I'm at
Never undercover but I'm wearing that
Cuban girl pretty, but get on my nerves
There's no point of leaving if you coming back
Most of these hoes be fiending
Most of these clothes European
Twin too geeked, keep speedin'
Smoke in my eyes, and gas in the seats, tint out the windows, can't see
My every word true, I'm talkin' my shit, I guess I'm the one they believe in
You might also like[Chrous]
Huh, just leave me alone, just leave me alone, just leave me alone
Cross on my neck bitch I feel like a pope
She tryna finesse play herself like a ho
She tryna be mad, but stuck in my posts
But when we not talking you jealous of hoes
You doing too much, just leave me alone
Just leave me alone, just leave me alone

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
