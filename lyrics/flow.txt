Counting up all that shit get to my head, boy, all of these niggas is fake
If i had a choice, i'd rather be dead, yeah-yeah
She finna worry about me, because I am too high
But I am counting up bread
Paranoid lil nigga with a lil stick on him, won't get caught by the feds

I'm probably finna jug to a nigga-

[Part I]
(icy)
You niggas not what I'm on
Nobody touching me in this shit
Niggas was [?] since i was a jit

[Part II]
Who did this like me?
Who flow this sound like?
Nigga this shit mine now, don't care if you like
Stop tryna be me, don't work when you try
In the cut with my young niggas, smoke yo pack trough pipes
I just want gas, i just want cash, i just want oxy, codeine, twin
You wanna laugh, I'm finna pass, all of your music, bolo' twin
Niggas not like that, I beat him up, he can't fight back (Uh-uh)
But if it was online, i swear to god he would type back

...a jit
Fuck it, I might gеt some clothes with my bitch
I'm on my own, she lеave me alone
Bad bitch and bitch finna roll me a blunt
She tryna FaceTime, I'm in the zone
Counting up all that shit get to my head, boy, all of these niggas is fake
If i had a choice, i'd rather be dead, yeah-yeah
She finna worry about me, because I am too high
But I am counting up bread
Paranoid lil' nigga with a lil stick on him, won't get caught by the feds
I'm probably finna jug to a nigga who, finished
Gas not good, for fitness
Drinking till a nigga finish
Gas not good, for fitness
Yeah-yeah, huh
Gas not good, for who?
Fuck all these niggas (these niggas-, these niggas-)Embed
