6 Contributorsâ€‹all gone Lyrics[Verse]
I feel so weird in the way that I thought you'd feel
Then the memories gone, it all goes away
The memories gone, it all goes away
There's something wrong with me that I can't explain
Yet it keeps growing on, like everyday
It keeps growing on, like everydayYou might also likeEmbed
