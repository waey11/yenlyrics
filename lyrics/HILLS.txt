I'm a crackhead for my cheese, I need my provolone
Get my money then I dip, I used to jugg up in them street's
Gettin' bored with all these bitches, need my-

[Verse]
Like, sh-, Like sh-
Like, "Shut up bitch, I'm tryna get my bread up"
I fucked his bitch
I'm like his mentions, keep yo' head up
N-N-Never switch up
I swear I never fold on cheddar
Exotic bitches, foreign whips, on my agenda
I got heals again

[Chorus]
In the hills again
Guess I'm in the hills again
In the hills again, nigga, in the hills again
In the hills again, bitch, I'm in the hills again
In the hills again

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo' bitch always blow my phone
I got bitches on they knees beggin' to take 'em home wit' me
I'm a crackhead for my cheese, I need my provolone
Get my money then I dip, I used to jugg up in them street's
Gettin' bored with all these bitches, need my LA hoe's

In the hills again
Guess I'm in the hills again
In the hills again, nigga, in the hills again
In the hills again, bitch, I'm in the hills again
In the hills againEmbed
