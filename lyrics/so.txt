Make me feel so good, make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good, make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good, make me feel so alive
Like how coping should
Meant to be, or to die
All I need is to know
I need you to decide
And let everything go
I need you to decide

Make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good
Make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good
Make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good
Make mе feel so alive
Make me feel so good

Makе me feel so good, make me feel so
Make me feel so good, make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good, make me feel so alive
Like how coping should
Meant to be, or to die
All I need is to know
I need you to decide
And let everything go
I need you to decide

Make me feel so good
Make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good
Make me feel so alive
Make me feel so good
Make me feel so alive
Make me feel so goodEmbed
