I don't even want to write this song
Ending myself, it won't be long
I know they said, to end up dead
And miserable, just sing along
(Get over yourself you make me sick)
I don't even want to write this song
Ending myself, it won't be long
I know they said, to end up dead
And miserable, just sing along
I don't need help, I've had myself-You might also likeEmbed
