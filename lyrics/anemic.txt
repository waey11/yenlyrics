(Yuh, aye)
And my old bitch really lost it
That drunk shit it get toxic (You have no)
That molly shit get toxic (You have no heart)
Sum like hypnotic
Smoke my breath I...
Yuh, smoke my breath I lost it
Been coughin' up exotics
So codeine fuck up my wallet
Piss boy you not it
Smoke like me you get nauseous
Bitch just wanna slide wit the gang (Yuh, yuh)
She gon’ say "fuck it" and hang
I-I'ma say "fuck it" and hang (Hate, ya, hate, ya)
Me and you just not the same-

[Chorus]
(Yuh, aye)
And my old bitch really lost it
That drunk shit, it get toxic (You have no)
That molly shit get toxic (You have no heart)
Sum like hypnotic
Smoke my breath I...
Yuh, smoke my breath I lost it
Been coughin' up exotics
So codeine fuck up my wallet
Piss boy you not it
Smoke like me you get nauseous (Piss)
Bitch just wanna slide wit the gang (Yuh, yuh)
She gon’ say "fuck it" and hang
I-I'ma say "fuck it" and hang (Hate, ya, hate, ya)
Me and you just not the same (Aye yuh)
How about you stay in yo lane (How about you stay in yo lane)
You gon' have to stay in yo lane (You gon' have to stay in yo lane)

And my trap not the same
If I buss at a nigga
My niggas they stain
We pull up, take brains
And then we gon dance
Why these niggas lame?
They don't know I did
We puttin' on bread
Like my nigga said
Pretty bitch on me, she tryna take a trip
Bad bitch on my phone off the rip
I saw walls close in on me
Trauma that you unloaded on me
Like I'm really feenin' (Like I’m really feenin’)
I really lost feelin'
I don’t know if you feel me
But I'm really feenin', shit like anemic
And she think she need me but won't pass that shit
You know I ain’t mean it (I ain't mean it)
(Bleh, bleh) Ha, yuh, yeah pull up, throwin' that money, I get it
Steppin' out of line nigga that's why I dead it
Crazy how I once seen a hoe go mental
Give her good dick now I ask her if she forget him
World class hoe bet the hoe need a medal
This the type of shit that make you sing falsetto
(Crazy how I once seen a hoe go mental)Embed
