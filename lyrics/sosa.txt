[intro]
(this is what we heard yet)
(corey, ho!)
(evil empire, evil empire)
(it’s the label)
(evvls, bitch!)

[Chorus]
Bitch im too plugged up, ngas got me fucked up 
Bitch i’m from the fo’, all my ngas from the mud bro
Ima knock up on yo door, (fa fa fa) that’s a dub bro 
All you ngas are so bitch, and you afraid to run yo’ ones bro

[Verse 1]
Yo’ bitch said that she “love me”, whatever that means
Give my “respirations ” bitch I feel like im kashdami
Too many ho’s, I might change my number so my phone blocked
Too many flows, too many posts, This choppa came with fuckin’ scopes
Shoutout to corey and tana i’m antisocial I jus’ wan talk for them bands

[Hook]
Yo bitch, on me, put her hands up in my pants
Ngas be talking that shit 
I’m the one who was putting ngas on, ngas dont understand
You like to run yo’ mouth, but you can’t run them hands
[Chorus x2]
Bitch im too plugged up, ngas got me fucked up 
Bitch i’m from the fo’, all my ngas from the mud bro
Ima knock up on yo door, (fa fa fa) that’s a dub bro 
All you ngas are so bitch, and you afraid to run yo’ ones bro

Bitch im too plugged up, ngas got me fucked up 
Bitch i’m from the fo’, all my ngas from the mud bro
Ima knock up on yo door, (fa fa fa) that’s a dub bro 
All you ngas are so bitch, and you afraid to run yo’ ones bro
