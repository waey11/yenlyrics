2 ContributorsIdiot Lyrics[Intro]
Sea World
Knife in my hand, like, “why'd it have to be-“

[Chorus]
Sea World
Knife in my hand, like, “why'd it have to be me?”
Backwood in my hand, sativa sticks in my dreams
Like, do I miss you?
Like, damn, I kind of wish you could see me
So much blood on the leaves, I don’t think you'll believe me
But I guess I’m at peace
(Cause, that’s what it’s been)
You have no heart

[Verse]
Listen to myself argue with the demons within
Dodging bullets from pussies, cause that’s the climate I’m in
I've been dying to spin back, cause I’m dying to win
I stepped off of thе pedestal, they said, “Jaydеs, why you did that?"
They think this a setback
I've been in that pussy, but it was just for a get back
And she won't forget that
These niggas dumb just blame it on me
(Just blame it on me)

Knife in my hand, like, “why'd it have to be me?”
Backwood in my hand, sativa sticks in my dreams
Like, do I miss you?
Like, damn, I kind of wish you could see me
So much blood on the leaves, I don’t think you'll believe me
But I guess I’m at peace
Cause, that’s what it’s been
Listen to myself argue with the demons within
Dodging bullets from pussies, cause that’s the climate I’m in

[Outro]
Dying to win
These niggas dumbEmbed
