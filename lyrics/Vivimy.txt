1 ContributorVivimy Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart!)

[Chorus: Jaydes]
Yeah, why you toying with my fucking brain? Woah
All these other girls are not the same, woah
All these women borin' me
They can't love you like I do
Why are you ignoring me? Yeah
(Silo killed this shit)
I might spend my racks now
Just to fill the void, yeah
Everybody's watching
Gas got me exhausted
Thought I had your heart
But I guess I really lost it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: jaydes]
I be in that brand new Benz
I be high like Peter Pan
She said since I'm on her playlist
That she might just bring her friend
Only hear my money count
Don't really care about your comments
Got a problem with my clique?
Then best believe that we gon' solve it

Yeah, why you toying with my fucking brain? Woah
All these other girls are not the same, woah

Why are you ignoring me? Yeah

[Chorus: heygwuapo]
Yeah
It's about that time of year when I get in my feelings
I'm the bad guy
You gon' try to paint me as a villain
It don't matter what I do
Just stack my bands up to ceiling, (uh)

[Verse 2: heygwuapo]

I'm finding closure
Baby, I love loving you
Girl, I just want you closer
You told me we'll be together
Even when we older
When we older
When we old
I got racks, yeah
In my bag, yeah
Move that pack, yeah
And that glocky on my side
It make 'em back up
Boy, you really short
You need to get your bag up
Yeah
