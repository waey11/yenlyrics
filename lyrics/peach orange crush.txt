Sea World
You have no heart

[Verse]
Is there something that you want from me?
Girl, just tell me the deal
Leave roses on your neck
Peach Crush to down these pills
Then fuck around in your bed
Tell me, is this what you want from me? (You want from me)

[Chorus]
Baby, show me how you feel
You're stuck up in your head, and I'm tryna make it real
Tocando tu cintura, bae your body too ideal
You know that I want you, yet, you always think I'm lying to you
Girl, you always think I'm lying to ya'
Yeah, you always think I'm lying too
You know I get tired of trying too

[Verse]
Sea World
Is there something that you want from me?
Girl, just tell me the deal
Leave roses on your neck
Peach Crush to down these pills
Then fuck around in your bed
Tell me, is this what you want for me? (You want from me)You might also likeEmbed
