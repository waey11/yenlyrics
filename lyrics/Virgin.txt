Yeah, ay
I feel so alone up in this skin
This shit is hurting me
I feel so alone up in my skin
Yeah
I feel so alone up in this skin
This shit is hurting me
Like everything so dead, baby
Just tell me is it worth it
I could barely give a fuck
About what you do behind curtains, baby
Well tell me is it worth it, baby
Tell me is it hurting, maybe
Tell me if it's hurting, baby
Tell me if it's hurting, tell me
Tell me is it worth it
Just tell me if it's hurting you
Just tell me if it's hurting you
Yeah
Designer might die
Just tell me what's inside
Just tell me when you cry
I swear you don't gotta hide
Just show me what's inside
Just show me what's inside
Just show me what's inside
Bae you don't gotta hide
Just show me what's inside
Just show me what's in-
Yeah
Tell me was it worth it, Ay yeah
Got out the jam with some Prozac on me
My ho can't stand when the feds get on me
Power, this shit getting strapped like the army
His ho on me, he still a little sorry
Drip honor roll, I was moving too gnarly
Drip honor roll, I was moving too gnarlyYou might also likeEmbed
