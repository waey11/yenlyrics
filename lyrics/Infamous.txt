[Verse]
Baby sippin' Hennessy and poppin' xans (Poppin' xans)
Yeah you different
You from a different planet
Sent you back and left I undid the damage
She walked down I said "I love it where her hand has been"
Anytime you cross my mind when I landed
My money dance I'm getting bread like I planned it
Still alone on this stage, like i'm doing stand up
I'm so high I pass the blunt to God
Bad ho, take advantage of my money
Need to put me on HULU or something
Put you back when I walk in
You walked up in the pack cause Im buggin-You might also likeEmbed
