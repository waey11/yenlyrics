11 ContributorsUndercover Lyrics[Intro]
(hoodrich)
Keep up, bitch
(You have no heart)

[Verse]
Undercover been my swag (Huh)
Number nine end up dead (Dead, up dead)
I kept it all to myself (Shh)
Might pop the pill off the stress, what?
I put a gun on my neck, damn
Maybe I'm stuck in my head
But it's play after play, state after state
If it's no pay, get out my way
Baby girl asking, "What's next?" (What's next?)
She tryna be a soldier, I'ma cop her a new tech (Tech)
I am not human, I sign me some titties and nigga, I sign me some checks (Yeah)
Skating and cruising, I got me some stones on my bae and some stones on my neck
Yeah, I'm just like Yuto, I'm boofin this blunt
Higher than Pluto, you can't even touch
Jaydes hit it better, I leave the bitch numb (yeah)
Undercover been my swag (Huh)
Number nine end up dead (Dead, up dead)
I kept it all to myself (Shh)
Might pop the pill off the stress, what?
I put a gun on my neck, damn
Maybe I'm stuck in my head
But it's play after play, state after state
If it's no pay, get out my way
Baby girl asking, "What's next?" (What's next?)
She tryna be a soldier, I'ma cop her a new tech (Tech)
I am not human, I sign me some titties and nigga, I sign me some checks (Yeah)
Skating and cruising, I got me some stones on my bae and some stones on my neck
Yeah, I'm just like Yuto, I'm boofin this blunt
Higher than Pluto, you can't even touch
Jaydes hit it better, I leave the bitch numb (yeah)
