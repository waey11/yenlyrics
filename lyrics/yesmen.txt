[Verse]
All my niggas Z'd up
You want smoke wimme, T up
You want smoke wimme, say sum
Gun you down wit a Nina
Yen cult, y'all believers
She said is that Yen? Yes maâ€™am
She see me all on her Instagram
She suck my dick like a fuckin fan
Can't fuc- can't fuck wit a yesman
I can't fuck wit a yesman
All my niggas know I'm stressed man
Teachi- Teachin these lil niggas lesson
.45 and we menacing
Made a nigga cap off investing
Pussy boy too depressing
I'ma put his style where [?]
All black, too menacing
Got my face mask, all menacing
Real face scar, real veteran
Ran up this shit, who you better than
Oh, I think I need her
Oh, I think I need her
I think that I need her
