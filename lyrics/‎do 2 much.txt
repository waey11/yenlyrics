[Chorus]
Why you faking? You not bussin' juggs (you have no heart)
Asian shawty on me and she showin' love
With the angels we came from above (Angels)
Do not try me, lil boy, don't test luck
Shut up, shut up, shut up, you doing too much, doing too much
Shut up, shut up, shut up, you doing too much, you doing too much
You do too much, 15 years old countin' bands, while your bands lookin' stuck
You need GoFundMe or something
Shut up, shut up, shut up, you doing too much, doing too much
Shut up, shut up, shut up, you doing too much, you doing too much
You do too much, 15 years of countin' bands, while your bands lookin' stuck
You need GoFundMe or something

[Verse]
I’m about to touchdown in LA like my name Shy
I heard your music, it was trash (trash)
You wanna feat better tax (tax)
Walk right in Neiman's, I walk into Saks (saks, saks)
Say you make money but you know it's cap
I came with a blick, shoot at your back
Your shawty want me cause I'm blowing tags (blowin' tags)
They say I'm next up but I do this all for fun
And that boy was talkin' crazy, time to hit em with that drum
He tryna look like me but he don't got the funds
Gеt that check and run it up
I feel like Tecca, out of luck
Glock is a bеat boy you get stunned
Hang with these bitches all for fun
Ima just keep on shootin' till he die
Yeah, you my shirt boy you get hung up
Big racks and I stack it up
Oh yeah she gon' back it up
Rolling a blunt, gon' pack it up
Don't let me catch you lackin'
(Evvls)

Why you faking? You not bussin' juggs

With the angels we came from above
Do not try me, lil boy, don't test luck
Shut up, shut up, shut up, you doing too much, doing too much
Shut up, shut up, shut up, you doing too much, you doing too much
You do too much, 15 years old countin' bands, while your bands lookin' stuck
You need GoFundMe or something

[Outro]
Shut up!
A quien le estas diciendo shut up tu, a tu perra diselo y te vasEmbed
