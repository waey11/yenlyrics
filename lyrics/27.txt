6 Contributors27 Lyrics[Intro]
You have no heart
(CG)
Yeah, yeah, nah

[Chorus: jaydes]
Balenciagas, yeah I don't gotta tie em
Its a party man you not invited
Smoking this gas got me flying
She told me that I'm perfect timing
I'm like baby why you lying?
I can't trust nobody else
That's why I always just keep to myself
I walk in the spot, they like you are the man
Your shawty want me that bitch is a fan
She told me that she don't got a man
I don't even care, I focus on bands
I'm with Rio, yeah, we heaven sent
27, yeah we making bands
Off the pixie dust like Peter Pan
Shawty hit my phone when she land

[Verse 1: Riovaz]
Yah
Girl, what you see in me?
Smoking this reefer, I'm making this greenery
Fucking your bitch and she say that she needing me
Don't wanna talk, let's just skip all that speaking please
She seen I'm running my bread, getting money
Hurting your feelings, go cry to your mommy
Designer your outfit but making no money
Said I'd fall off but I'm up now, that's funny
Manipulate women cause bitches so dummy
Shawty so mad and she said that I'm mean
Walk with a limp, yeah, I carry a beam
Talk all that shit but you hide through a screen
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know, okay

I'm making money your bitch acting funny when she get around me, cause I got the cash
You said that you from the hood, but you are from the suburbs
You already know that's cap
I was down bad for a minute but now I'm going up and never coming in last
I'm in a SRT yeah I'm switching these lanes
You can never go too fast

[Chorus: jaydes]
Balenciagas, yeah I don't gotta tie em
Its a party man you not invited
Smoking this gas got me flying
She told me that I'm perfect timing
I'm like baby why you lying?
I can't trust nobody else
That's why I always just keep to myself
I walk in the spot, they like you are the man
Your shawty want me that bitch is a fan
She told me that she don't got a man
I don't even care, I focus on bands
I'm with Rio, yeah, we heaven sent
27, yeah we making bands
Off the pixie dust like Peter Pan
Shawty hit my phone when she landEmbed
