Yeah, clip

[Chorus]
Long like a ruler (You have no heart)
Hanging with my shooters (Jamie)
If he acting clueless
We gon' have to do him
Rick on my shoes, bitch
But your bitch in Jimmy Choo
Do not let her fool you
Do not let her fool you (Go)

[Chorus]
Long like a ruler
Hanging with my shooters (Jamie)
If he acting clueless
We gon’ have to do him
Rick on my shoes, bitch
But your bitch in Jimmy Choo, ha
Do not let her fool you
Do not let her fool you (Yeah, go)

[Verse]
Ain't nobody do it like me right now (Yeah)
Tell your fuck nigga pipe down
Listen to that money count
Listen to me getting guala
Making this money and dip I'm out
Niggas be talkin’, they not really bout that
He need to get my name out of his mouth
Yo' shit be getting old
So you had to steal my flow
Your main bitch is my hoe
Why she reposts all my post
She keep saying I'm too cold
Honest truth is what I told
Not the only one, I can't hold you
Only focused on what I'm supposed to
You might also like[Chorus]
Long like a ruler
Hanging with my shooters (Jamie)
If he acting clueless
We gon' have to do him
Rick on my shoes, bitch
But your bitch in Jimmy Choo
Do not let her fool you
Do not let her fool you (Go)

Long like a ruler
Hanging with my shooters (Jamie)
If he acting clueless
We gon' have to do him
Rick on my shoes, bitch
But your bitch in Jimmy Choo, ha
Do not let her fool you
(Do not let her fool you)

[Outro]
(Too clueless)
