21 Contributors​slugs Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart)
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, he gon' catch up to these slugs
DDoS on that nigga, now he easy to get jugged (Easy to get ju—)
I ran up my bands, but I'll still run off on the plug
She up in my DMs, expect me to give a f-fuck
I can't cuff that ho, her nigga is a herb bro
I'ma sellout shows, gon' kick hoes to the curb bro
Never gon' forget when bitches used to curve me
I cannot progress on these freak hoes they got herpes—

[Verse]
Archive in my closet
She fuck with my fashion and she fuck with my deposits
I'm up like I promised
I get hate up in my comments, get my bag regardless
I was being nice when I said mid, your shit is garbage
I know your bitch want me but I won't do it to you
All my niggas got them slugs, they gon' shoot 'em through you
They gon' slide, they gon' put a toolie' up to your medulla
Ha, I don’t know what I'ma tell you, like BKTHERULA

[Chorus]
Yeah, he gon' catch up to these slugs
DDoS on that nigga, now he easy to get jugged (Easy to get ju-)
I ran up my bands, but I'll still run off on the plug
She up in my DMs, expect me to give a f-fuck
I can't cuff that ho, her nigga is a herb bro
I'ma sellout shows, gon' kick hoes to the curb bro
Never gon' forget when bitches used to curve me
I cannot progress on these freak hoes they got herpes
