(You have no heart!)

[Verse]
Had to tell lil' shawty, "Move on"
And she said I'm fucked up, 'cause we fucked to my songs
Tall, my money really up, and it's stuck, and it's long
Niggas tryna double cross, man this shit get flawed
Bad bitch on my dick, and she lookin' for a job
My lil' shawty can't breathe, put a (pssh) in her jaw
I'm geeked
We gon' make a song?
Let's see
Run up the bands for a feat
Yeah, think I put a spell on his bitch
Now her boyfriend wanna be like me
Now her boyfriend wanna be like me
Just like me, just like me
Now her boyfriend wanna bе like me
