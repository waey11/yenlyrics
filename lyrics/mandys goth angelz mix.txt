2 Contributors​mandys goth angelz mix Lyrics[Part I: so]

(gothangelz)
I am so blue
How can I show you?

An empty crib
A dirty gift

[Part II: salad days]

[Verse 1]
She was my retribution
The body's decomposing
She scratched me on my shoulder
But I told her we're fine
Everything's so pointless
And everyone's a loser
You need to hear it when you're in need of your own life ([?] loser)

[Verse 2]
My retribution's gone, she's just another blonde
Her cold and lifeless body was supposed to move on
And maybe I'm just joking, but maybe I'm not kidding
I'd love to play pretend, but all the kidding mе is gone
Oh, there's no sirеns
Nobody's gonna hear it when you scream
Oh, it's so quiet
You might also like[Part III: pretend]

[Intro]
Just go fuck yourself

[Verse]
Gonna crack a rib when I get home (You're so goddamn pathetic, you're so goddamn pathetic)
I'm gonna bury you in my favorite hole (You're so goddamn pathetic)
I made a bloody mess in the kitchen sink
I tried to fix myself, but I didn't think

[Outro]
They said
Hahahaha

[Part IV: skin]

[Chorus]
Find me in your skin (Find me in your skin)
None of this feels real
I know where you sleep
What we had was real

[Verse]
Nothing's left, I feel empty inside (Lie)
For what it's worth, you can't lie to yourself
And you know that I tried
[Chorus]
Find me in your skin

[Part V: oh the agony]

[Intro]
Hold on

[Chorus]
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging
I feel there's nothing for me here and I'm trying to get out
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?

[Verse]
I fell into your void, a feeling I can't shake
Do you want me okay?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?

[Chorus]
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging
I feel there's nothing for me here and I'm trying to get out
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging
I feel there's nothing for me here and I'm trying to get out
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you want me insane?
I don't see your point, do you—
