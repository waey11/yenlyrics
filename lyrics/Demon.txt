2 ContributorsDemon Lyrics[Intro]
I fucked this bitch for no reason
I used to hang with the angels, now a young nigga turned to a demon

[Verse]
Too damn hot, too damn hot I’m tweaking
My bitch want a Perc, yeah, she feening
My bitch give me head up in Neimans
I turned my bitch into seasons
I fucked this bitch for no reason
I used to hang with the angels, now a young nigga turned to a demon
Bitch I’m not going for shit, bitch I’m not going for shit
I’m the type nigga to get my bag, get a type, nigga, record in it
Bitch, send me your coordinates, send me your coordinates
Send me your coordinates, send me your coordinates, yeah
Too damn hot, too damn hot I’m tweaking
My bitch want a Perc, yeah, she feening
My bitch give me head up in Neimans
I turned my bitch into seasons
I fucked this bitch for no reason
I used to hang with the angels, now a young nigga turned to a demon
Bitch I’m not going for shit, bitch I’m not going for shit
I’m the type nigga to get my bag, get a type, nigga, record in it
Bitch, send me your coordinates, send me your coordinates
Send me your coordinates, send me your coordinatesYou might also likeEmbed
