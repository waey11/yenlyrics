13 Contributorsâ€Žoffensive Lyrics[Intro]
I'm with yo' bitch, and she wanna be mine
Niggas keep playing 'till somebody die
Steppin' so clean, and I'm not talkin' Tide
Your shorty know how to vibe-

[Chorus]
I'm just countin' up my racks, bro, why you so offended?
If you do not like me get the fuck out of my mentions
Haha, yeah you mad, fuck y'all (Evvls)
Posted up right now, but if I see twelve, I'm gone
I'm just countin' up my racks, bro, why you so offended?
If you do not like me get the fuck out of my mentions
Haha, yeah you mad, fuck y'all
Posted up right now, but if I see twelve, I'm gone

[Verse]
Racks in my jeans (yeah, yeah yeah)
Y'all some rats, don't got no cheese
Want a feat, then pay a fee
Smoking gas, it's hard to breathe
Smoking gas, it's hard to see
Nobody as hard as me
Smoking this zaza, it's hard to sing
Gather my bread, I'm harvesting
I'm with yo' bitch, and she wanna be mine
Niggas keep playing 'till somebody die
Steppin so clean, and I'm not talkin' Tide
Yo shorty know how to vibe
1, 2, 3, all these women are some fiends (yuh)
White bitch in the back, geekin' off the nicotine for real (uhh)

Haha, yeah you mad, fuck y'all
Posted up right now, but if I see twelve, I'm gone
I'm just countin' up my racks, bro, why you so offended? (yeaah)
If you do not like me get the fuck out of my mentions
Haha, yeah you mad, fuck y'all
