Woke up shawty still at my pad, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Wake up bae, you still at my pad, yuh
Was off of them drugs, like "what happened?"
I'm feeling you lately, lucky you back
Baby girl you crazy, we know we crazy
That's why you tryna be my baby
I ain't know you crazy, you a lil freak
Baby tryna fuck on a date, yeah ooh
I roll me a blunt and i'm cooling
Mami fuckin with how i'm moving
I'm stacking up this guap and they clueless
Niggas tryna copy my movements
I really stay on top of my duties
Baby gimme top when i request
Like "what you want, what you need"
She finna pop her a x
I'm smoking designer weed, in here baby
I was slowed up off a xan
And i'm the one you wanna be with
Doing shit you ain't seen before
Yuh, yuh
Wake up baе, you still at my pad, yuh
Was off of them drugs, like "what happenеd?"
I'm feeling you lately, lucky you back
Baby girl you crazy, we know we crazy
That's why you tryna be my baby
I ain't know you crazy, you a lil freak
Baby tryna fuck on a date, yeah ooh
