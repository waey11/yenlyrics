3 ContributorsYHU MA SUN Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I'm thinkin' I fell in love with the penicillin
(the sativa)
(the sativa)
(you know I had to come with the heat)
(you know I had to come with the heat)
I think I fell in love, (yeah)
(You have no heart)

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinkin' I fell in love with the penicillin
Bitch, I'm mixin' up Fanta, Codeine, and Hennessy
Killin' myself is my only pleasant feelin'
They been sayin' that I'm selfish with no heart of feelings
They been sayin' that I'm selfish with no heart of feelings
(You have no heart)
Yen do be winning, currency my ceiling
I think that he's up and not enough for minute

Make that lil boy spin, choppa, make him touch his limit
These boys broke, they on the block, they know they pockets midget
I see niggas try bite the swag, I let them fumble with it
I said, "Gimme that" and then lil bitch, I'm juggin' your shit
Bitch, I'm juggin' your shit, yeah
Bitch, I'm juggin' your shit, yeah
He said he like Draco's, so we drillin' his shit (yeah)
Yeah, we killin' his jit, yeah
Yeah, we killin' his bitch, yeah (blah)
Yeah, homicide
(You have no heart)
(You have no heart)
(Homicide, homicide, homicide)You might also likeEmbed
