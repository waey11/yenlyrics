4 ContributorsClaire Lyrics[Intro]
(you have no heart)

[Chorus]
It's not even fair
I need a bad bitch one just like Claire
Shawty so bad, feet to her hair
She got a boyfriend I don't really care
(her, her)
I'm about to fall in love
I swear the girl she my drug
I'm about to fall in love. (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'll do it all for you
I swear that I didn't want to fall for you
It's her I can't like
Exactly what I like
I can't tell no lie
Baby you're one of a kind (baby you're one of a kind)

[Verse 1]
Shawty bad, Claire
Shawty bad, Claire
Shawty bad, Claire
Shawty bad, Claire
Shawty bad
Shawty bad, Claire
[?]
Everything, Claire
