2 ContributorsFEAR OF GODS Lyrics[Verse]
Woah, yeah
Woah, yeah
I think my niggas ready to slime em out
I think my niggas ready to slime em out
Yeah I’m smoking this blunt in front of his house
When i was locked up though I ain’t get no cell
When I was locked up I ain’t get no cell for real
Nigga try to wrap me up, boy, I can't be around

His dumbass ain't gonna waste a round
Wanna see they gonna leave you down
Wanna see they gonna leave you down
Red dot and his muzzle gold crown
Pussy ass nigga [?] now

Everybody wanna be a king [?], so let's shut it out
Like when I up it if you get in the way imma kill, you

Woah, yeah
Woah, yeah
I think my niggas ready to slime em out
I think my niggas ready to slime em out
Yeah I’m smoking this blunt in front his house
Locked up though I ain’t get no cell
When I was locked up I ain’t get no cell for realYou might also likeEmbed
