12 Contributors​spaz Lyrics[Intro]
Yuh
Told that bitch, "No touchin'"
Woods on me, they Russian
She asked "Why we rushin'?"
I'm not waitin' for nothin'
Wrist full of diamonds
Shinin' they blushi-

[Verse 1]
(Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
Pussy ass nigga, stop actin' dumb
You gon' make me mad
You gon' make me come over there like I'm an angry dad
Pull up, and I spaz
Pull up, and I spaz
You better know how to act around me
If you don't boy, you get slapped
Psh, AR on me, I'm not playin'
Turn that shit off, can't even hear what you sayin'
It gon fly I Garage Valet it
She gon' hit this blunt and fly away, yeah
She gon' hit this blunt and fly away

[Chorus]
Yuh
Told that bitch, "No touchin'"
Woods on me, they Russian
She asked "Why we rushin'?"
I'm not waiting for nothin'
Wrist full of diamonds
Shinin' they blushin'

Yuh, I just pull up and spaz, yeah
I just pull up and spaz, yeah
Rollin' with that pack, I put one-twenty on the dash
Broke ass nigga, get ya' cash up
How you gon' ask the world from me, but enemy last yeah
These niggas tryna plot on me, but that's my last fear
Keep the windows closed, cause you know I keep a Mac in
They talking bout some exposin, tryna get mad over my actions
Tell my niggas action
I'm lookin for Rick, I can't really find no Actavis
Yuh

[Outro]
Pull up, and I spaz
Pull up, and I spaz
