Cracks all on my skin [?]
[?] on my sidewalk
Thought that we had something, I was wrong
Was wrong
And I don't know too much, but I don't say enough
I'm just too hard to love, so it might be for the better
(But you)
But you say it every time, so I just move your hand
Tell me you'll be fine
And I don't know too much, but I don't say enough
I'm just too hard to love, so it might be for the better
(But you)
She said it's all my head, she said I need some sleep
But I feel better off without herYou might also likeEmbed
