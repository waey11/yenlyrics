14 Contributors‎migraine Lyrics[Verse]
I just got a migraine from soft whispers in my head
Now there's nothing that I wanted, I'm just left here, unimpressed
Took advantage of my kindness and left me a fuckin' mess
Crawling deep inside my skin, I tried concealing all my flesh
I know you know (I know you know)
You're wasting my time (You're wasting my time)
I know you know, you're wasting my time
(It makes my head ache)You might also likeEmbed
