4 Contributors2020tb freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
I'm getting cash
Not gon' lie
This shit boring
Sometimes want a job
Because this shit annoying

(You have no heart)
(Evil)

Yuh, step in the spot
[?] I'm smoking a lot
Nigga talk tough, he get tied like a knot
Don't wanna fuck, 'cause that bitch is a thot
Fourteen years old making more money
Free all my dogs, and rest in piece to bunny
Whippin' these cars and boy you lookin'
Popping these percs is not good for my tummy
Talkin my shit, I might run up and pop up a xannie
A fiend, you can call me El Chapo
I got a xannie, gon' face all my problems
There's lean in my cup, and there's [?] in the bottle
[?] 'cause I got a choppa on auto
Don't run up on me, get hit with the [?]
I'm sippin' this wocky [?] bottle
Body a Benz, but her ass is a Tahoe
On god
