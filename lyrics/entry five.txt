Cuts on my hands, I can't hold yours
I feel stripped of my skin, and alone
Tell me what happened to me
Face in the pavement
Look what you made me do

Cuts on my hands, I can't hold yours (Hold yours)
I feel stripped of my skin, and alone
Tell me what happened to me (Tell me)
Face in the pavement (Face in the)
Look what you made me do (Oh)

Look what you made me do
(Blame it on the rain outside)
Look what you made me do

Look what you made me do
