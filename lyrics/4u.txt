7 Contributors4u Lyrics[Verse]
(You have no heart)
I'm falling for you girl (Fallin' for you)
Tripped on my own laces
Lost in ways, I can't explain it
And you don't see me complainin'

[Chorus]
Fallin' for you, it's all in my head
It's all in my head, it's all in my head
Can't fall for you, you're all in my head (All in my head)
You're all in my head (All in my head), you're all in my headYou might also likeEmbed
