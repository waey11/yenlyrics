5 Contributors‎step Lyrics[Chorus: Jaydes]
Watch your step
I got bitches on me, I got riches on me
She knows I'm the man
Got digits on me, I got digits on me
If I wanted to I could fuck your bitch
15, I was born in 06
Shout out my niggas, they hitting them licks
Used to hate on me now asking for flicks
Damn, she tryna show me love, like Tecca
I got the VV from what's on my necklace
Run up on the gang, end up on a stretcher
She throwin' it back, I guess I'm a catch it
She asked for my zodiac sign, I'm like "What?"
"I want what you have", I don't give a fuck
Making bands you knew that I am so up
Making plays I do that, you out of luck

[Verse: Heyguwapo]
Woah
My niggas don't give a fuck
I'm tryna know whats up
I'm with my shooters posted in the cut
We gon' be on time, why you in a rush?
I stay on my grind likе I'm [?]
I stay with the fire bitch I keep it tucked
Wе gon' take your life if you play with us
Shawty telling lies bitch I've had enough
Watch your step, watch your step
I got bitches on me, I got bitches on me
I walk around with a big stick
Could take your bitch quick
I know you gon' throw a big fit
She calling back cause she miss it
I shoot my shot I don't miss it
Y'all niggas bitches
