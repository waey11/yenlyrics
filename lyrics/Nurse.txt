2 ContributorsNurse Lyrics[Verse]
I won't be bothered to be around anymore
(around anymore)
I hate bothering you
(Bothering you, it's bothering me)
I know this girl from a town that works at the pharmacy
I fiend for another xan
When I'm dying to cover up what's wrong with me
What's wrong with me
What's wrong with me
What's wrong with me
What's wrong with meYou might also likeEmbed
