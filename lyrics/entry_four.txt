[Intro]
Ma-maybe she likes me
Maybe she's toying with me

[Verse]
(Maybe she likes me) Falling in love is a tricky one for me (Maybe she's toying with me)
(Maybe she likes me) I trust you but don't wanna get fucked up (Maybe she's toying with me)
(Maybe she likes me) You heard all my secrets (Maybe she's toying with me)
I like your responses (Maybe she likes me)
Though I wanna see this (Maybe she's toying with me)
The pressure feels awful
(Maybe she likes me) Text you and delete it (Maybe she's toying with me)
It's been rainy outside (Maybe she likes me)
Gave you my jacket in case you needed it (Maybe she's toying with me)
She won't hear this

[Outro]
Maybe she likes me
