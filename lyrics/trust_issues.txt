[Verse 1]
Evil
Ayy, tame up, comment on my shit but keep yo chain tucked
Evvls is an Angel, but at night I get fanged up
Nigga you my seed, talking crazy, you get banged up
I'm just smoking on my weed, you not with us 'cause u lame bruh
Your man was a shooter 'til I asked about his hands
Flipping packs, I upped the trap, then fucked your bitch and popped a xan
That boy saw the beam, told his friends and they ran
Shut the fuck up, I don't wanna talk if it ain't bands

[Chorus]
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes
I can't fuck wit hoes

[Post-Chorus]
Yo bitch ran thru nigga I can't fuck wit hoes
That bitch was a hoe so I know I can't fuck wit those
Yo bitch ran thru nigga I can't fuck wit hoes
That bitch was a hoe so I know I can't f-

[Verse 2]
Shawty fuckin' with my head I'm not gon' lie
She don't fuck wit me no more, don't know why
But its okay, making this money like I'm moving cocaine
Talk down on the Angels? its a closed case
(bah, bah, bah) You not gon' feel no pain
She gon' wanna slide, 'cause I'm getting that chicken, no lo-mein
Yes I'm that goat, aye
Yes that bitch knows
Should've known it from the start, should've never trust a hoe

[Outro]
You need to leave!
