1 ContributorBefore rehab Lyrics[Verse]
Yeah, I messed up, I know, just don't rub it in
All the thoughts gon' start flooding in
Staying on myself when I start cutting in
Think I'm in trouble, I think so
I don't know so I'll just wait
Cuts on my wrist are the only thing that's stray
But I'm okay, yeah, I'm alright
I'm okay, yeah, I'm just fine
And I'm tired of lying to myself
And I don't need your help
And I don't need your help
And I hate that I'm the first thing that I think of
So fucking selfish, not good for my health
And I'm tired of lying to myself
And I don't need your help
And I don't need your help
And I hate that I'm the first thing that I think of
So fucking selfish, I'm a narcissist

[Outro]
And I make the worst decisions and I hate it
Really sucks there's only one way to escape it
And I make the worst decisions and I hate it
Really sucks thеre's only one way to escapе it
And I swear that I'm tired of lying to myself
And I don't want your help
And I don't want your help
And I swear that I'm tired of lying to myself
And I don't want your help
And I don't want your help
And I swear that I'm tired of lying to myself
And I don't want your help
And I don't want your help
And I swear that I'm tired of lying to myself
Don't want your help
Yeah, I don't want your helpYou might also likeEmbed
