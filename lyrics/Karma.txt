11 ContributorsKarma Lyrics[Intro: jaydes]
I got money, I’m not different, just distant
I got money, I’m not different, just distant
I got money, I’m not different, just distant
Industry ain’t no competition, I swear
Jaydes in here, ballin’ like a piston, I swe—, (You have no heart)
(Damn, DJ Phat)

[Chorus: jaydes]
Pray for my niggas, can that karma catch up?
Only turn you into a lick, If you really let us
I got different priorities, I know she fed up
I got—, I got money, I’m not different, I’m just distant
In the street, no competition, I swear
Jaydes in here, ballin’ like a piston, I swear
Different A&R, same mission, I swear
Got everything and she don’t deserve me
You gon’ see how much you need me, I play petty too

[Verse: jaydes]
I’m from mister “I’m a libra, when I’m ready too”
You don’t know me, you don’t know this type of  empty, boo
You don’t know me, you don’t know this type of empty, boo
He tryna finesse, boy, I’mma ahead of you
He got robbed, told him “It was for the better do”
I’m trying to teach lil bro, how to get his cheddar too

Different A&R, same mission, I swear
Got everything and she don’t deserve me
You gon’ see how much you need me, I play petty too
