There's these woods I know
That nobody goes to
We should totally go to
(gunshot)

[Verse]
Clawing at my skin
Making sure I'm real
Every time I get here
I feel alone

[Chorus]
There's these woods I know
That nobody goes to
We should totally go to
Even for a sec'
When I grab your neck
We look how we're supposed toYou might also likeEmbed
