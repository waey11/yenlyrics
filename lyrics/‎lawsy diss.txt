[Verse]
Ayy, he got a song called stick but he won't tote that shit (You have no heart) (Plug)
Yeah, lil' nigga you fell off and you ain't even know that shit
It's a white boy with a middle part talkin' crazy, didn't even notice him
He had a perfect persona, heard his verse and threw a fit
You a junkie ass nigga, you a mayo monkey ass nigga
Damn, that Rick look a lil' funky ass nigga, yeah
CapzLock took your bitch, ha, 'cause he looks like princes
Angles too big for your fit, ha, look like you give out detentions

[Part II]

[Verse]
All of your music is ass, yeah
All of your music is ass, yeah
All of your music is ass, yeah
All of your music is ass, yeah
All of your music is ass, yeah
All of your music is ass, yeah
All of your music is ass
Smokin' on your pack, fuckin' up my voice
Skinny and fat, nigga, pick a choice
Walkin' up the stairs, he makin' that noise
Lil Huddy hair cut, you like boys
And he can't move in them fuckin' skinny jeans
This nigga wakes up and eats Jimmy Dean's
This nigga family came from a trailer park— (Alright, I'm done)You might also likeEmbed
