You have no heart!
Yeah, yeah
Aye, phew

[Verse]
I'm really that nigga (Really that nigga)
Had to get my bands up
They think that she dubbed me
Had to get my mans up
This shit gettin' ugly
Fuck nigga be fanned out
It's this pistol that I'm clutching
Clutching, I'm clutching
Bitch plot me, they say, "Fuck me"
Fuck me, fuck me (Up)
Nigga, caught 'em up (Caught 'em up, yuh)
On the Macbook, hit a jugg (Hit a jugg)
Count my money up, these niggas is too stuck
Been throwin' all my hands up, pourin' lean
Club, we gon' shoot it up
Throwin' up, in the fuckin' club
I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I'm up on these drugs
If it's luck, they say, "Fuck Jaydes!"
And his bitch in my phone, had to let her know what's up
He keep blood, from his nose
Tryna let him know it's up
I been boofin' good pack
USB, in my lungs
I could nеver go back
I could never go back
I could nеver go backYou might also likeEmbed
