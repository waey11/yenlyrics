2 Contributorsâ€‹situation Lyrics[Chorus]
And I'm in a situation, I can't deny
I got way too many options, I can't decide, yeah
You can't do me wrong, and then expect me to be nice
But it's okay that you tried
It's not okay that I care for you-ou
It's not my fault, man, I swear (Not my fault)
Doing shit to my brand, can't get you out hair (Out of my hair)
And you keep waking me up, just to bring me right down
Do not need this right now (This shit driving me crazy)
And I'm in a situation, I can't deny
I got way too many options, I can't decide, yeah
You can't do me wrong, and then expect me to be nice
But it's okay that you tried
It's not okay that I care for you-ou
It's not my fault, man, I swear (Not my fault)
Doing shit to my brand, can't get you out hair (Out of my hair)
And you keep waking me up, just to bring me right down
Do not need this right now

[Verse]
Got me so exhausted, I swear that I lost it, her love
At least I'm profiting, I might fucking off and be gone
Got me so exhausted, I swear that I lost it, her love
At least I'm profiting, I might fucking off and be gone
Got me so exhausted, I swear that I lost it, her love
At least I'm profiting, I might fucking off and be gone
Got me so exhausted, I swear that I lost it, her love
At least I'm profiting, I might fucking off and be goneYou might also likeEmbed
