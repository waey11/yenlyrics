3 ContributorsI might die Lyrics[Intro]
Aye, aye
Real jugg shit, '23
Still jugging, fuck twelve
Fuck these niggas

[Verse]
Yeah, I can't even jugg like that my hands got tied
Hands got tied
I got locked up no surprise, yeah
Beat that pussy-boy he try me he must wanna die, yeah
All my opps died
Bitch I'm smokin' suicide, yeah
Money on my bed I'm fitted fuck a suit and tie, yeah
My lil' thot take LSD then fuck on my guy
With me in that casket where my money gon' reside
We get too much money call it Yеn call it "I", yeah
My lil' shawty mad at me cause shе ain't get no phone calls
Twelve keep tryna book me bitch, I set my own laws
Give me good brain I give her a diploma
Love it when you choke up I love it when you foam up
Yeah, red 4 on me off the Molly throwing up
FBI agent said give the phone up
Suck my dick bitch I think you know enough
If I see that bitch then that nigga rolling up
If I see that bitch then that nigga loading up
If I see that bitch then that nigga loading up
If I see that bitch then that nigga running up
If I see that bitch then that nigga rolling upYou might also likeEmbed
