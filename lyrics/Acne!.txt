13 ContributorsAcne! Lyrics[Intro]
Really like-really like-really like-really like-I really like using cash

[Chorus]
Yeah
Niggas was hatin' on me now look at me I'm gettin' on cash beats
(You have no heart!)
I leave all these women jaw dropped when I run up a check like a track meet
Young nigga 15 wit' a playbook
Studied that shit like I was a athlete
If you want the smoke come drag me
Choppa in the backseat, pop you like acne (Woah)
Girl in the back calling me her baby
My pockets on fat thеy been fatter lately
Without my cash I'm going crazy (Okay)
She gonna wait 'til I'm in LA
Bitch you know mе on a first name basis
She hit me up like "Where you at jaydes?"
(Plug)

[Verse]
She hit me up, she hittin' my line
I get these hoes like 2 at a time
Designer my pants these hoes number nine
Posted in Broward I be in the four
I got my nigga's knockin' at your door
Lil bitch, jugg the spot if you home
She askin' me why I don't pick up my phone
Bitch, 'cause I be all in my zone

Niggas was hatin' on me now look at me I'm gettin' on cash beats

If you want the smoke come drag me
Choppa in the backseat, pop you like acne (Woah)
Girl in the back calling me her baby
My pockets on fat they been fatter lately
Without my cash I'm going crazy (okay)
She gonna wait 'til I'm in LA
Bitch you know me, on a first name basis
She hit me up like "Where you at jaydes?"

Yeah

I leave all these women jaw dropped when I run up a check like a track meet
Young nigga 15 wit' a playbook
Studied that shit like I was a athlete

Choppa in the backseat, pop you like acne (Woah)
