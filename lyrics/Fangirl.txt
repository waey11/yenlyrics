I'm busy fantasizing
I ain't even gon' remember my name when I start dying
Said, "Where the hoes at?" I got plenty but they not her
Hear that boy talkin' down, we get that semi put him on a shirt

{Verse]
Damn, okay okay
Damn, okay, damn, yeah
Shawty off the xans
Ask me, "What's the plan?", yeah
She told me she a fan
She don't got no mans
I spent my time profiling
I'm busy fantasizing
I ain't even gon' remember my name when I start dying
Said, "Where the hoes at?" I got plenty but they not her
Hear that boy talkin' down, we get that semi put him on a shirt
(Y-y-y-y-y-you have no heart!)

{Verse]
Damn, okay okay
Damn, okay, damn, yeah

Ask me, "What's the plan?", yeah
She told me she a fan
She don't got no mans
I spent my time profiling
I'm busy fantasizing
I ain't even gon' remember my name when I start dying
