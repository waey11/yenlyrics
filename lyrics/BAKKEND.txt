[Verse]
Came up from papa now I'm learning how to pimp
Whip on a hoe, hit a jugg on a simp (lets run it)
Zip up my young nigga onto a lick
Try to steal the sauce but that nigga not him
Really put the 4 on my back cause I'm him
Nigga is a hoe and he posted with his boyfriends
Bitch give me throat, leave Jaydes on her chin
White tee, Jay-Z how a nigga walk in
And a nigga think he win cause that nigga is my kid and his soul got took (like damn, aye)
I was looking for them bands еver since I was a jit
I was looking wherе to look (like damn, like damn)
Let the real niggas eat, no fucks for the fake
Lil' Jaydes eating good
Put a nigga in a wood, now I'm up and he ain't
He would kill me if he could (damn)
I had to come out the backend (yuh)
Why these fuck niggas ratting (yuh)
I hit the bitch once now she chatting (yuh)
Had to cut all the capping up
Came out the field and I'm rapping (yuh)
Pyramid how I'ma stack it up
I swear, do this shit automatic (hoe automatic, cop me the patek)You might also likeEmbed
