2 ContributorsFind Me Out Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart)
Duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh
She’s fuckin’ around i’m having visions of it
Chills down my spine, i’m not crying
Come find me out, I can’t find myself
Don’t find me out
Don’t find me out

[Chorus]
Her curse, everything feels so painful
She took my heart and left it out on the pavement
Her curse, everything feels so painful
My veins keep hurtin’ and I need someone to save me

[Outro]
Shes fuckin’ around i’m having visions of it
Chills down my spine, i’m not crying
Come find me out, I can’t out myself
Don’t find me outYou might also likeEmbed
