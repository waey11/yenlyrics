10 Contributors​sick Lyrics[Intro]
You, You, You
“That nigga Evvls can run a fade too, bruh, I’ma keep it real nigga oh yeah, alright nigga”

[Chorus]
Blocking these bitches they making me sick
Hit up the Neiman's, spend racks on my fit
Talk with your chest nigga, whatchu' need, Vicks?
Too many bitches I'm tired of it
Put on some Vivienne, I mix with the Rick
I need a hoe gon' take me some flicks
She said we friends I'm not showing no signs
I'ma say fuck it and blow her a kiss
I'm used to the money, you're foreign to it
I'm making hits, I made four in a row
She said she love me I say that's a joke
Convo deleted, that's just how it goes
I'm reppin' 27 bitch I'm postеd with Rio
They think we sold our souls
Why lil' bro hating like hе wasn't asking for feats though?

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know uh, I don't know yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Lil shawty count it up
Lil baby high off the Adderalls
My day hasn't been that bad at all
I don't know yeah, I don't know, I don't know
Lil shawty count it up
Lil baby high off the Adderalls
My day hasn't been that bad at all
