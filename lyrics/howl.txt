[Chorus]
Broke her heart (hi yuke)
That was the first time I failed
Really been him from the start
Blocking my head from the hail
New pretty hoe, made a fan sign
She put my name on her nails
Smoking these blunts till my ants fried
I’m moving slow like a snail

[Verse 1]
When they pull up, boy you can’t hide
My shooters catch you like odell
All of these hoes got my hands tied
She said she want my shit on grailed
Really locked up in my damn head, too bad that my bitch was the bail
Free all my niggas that did time, I'ma get grave outta jail

[Verse 2]
Jaydes got the key to her soul
She see me up on the stage
She acting dumb at the show
Like why they here screaming your name, yeah
White bitches off of the coke, huh
It’s like welcome to la, yeah
I broke my heart and I coped, huh
Had to go straight to the bank, yeah

Broke her heart
That was the first time I failed
Really been him from the start
Blocking my head from the hail
New pretty hoe, made a fan sign
She put my name on her nails
Smoking these blunts till my ants fried
I’m moving slow like a snailEmbed
