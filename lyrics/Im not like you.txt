Woah (yeah, yeah, yeah, skrr, skrr)

[Chorus]
Say you my buddy, you changed, you on that bum shit
Only thing you finessin', is this full clip (blick)
[?] I might buy up some more Rick
I be on them flicks, 'cause I'm pretty and I'm rich (ha!)

[Verse]
I could pull yo' mommy if I wanted to
Need that purple, and that red, I don't wanna choose
Always lurkin in the dark cause I don't wanna lose
Off them perkies, and that molly,she see molecules
Niggas forgot I was evil, I could turn that bitch back on
I'm finna hit a jugg, fuck yo bitch, and play this song (yeah)
Pretty small nigga, but my money lookin strong (yeah)
Born in 06', but my money look grown as fuck (ha)

[Chorus]
Say you my buddy, you changed, you on that bum shit
Only thing you finessin is this full clip (blick)
[?] I might buy up some more Rick
I be on them flicks cause I'm pretty and I'm rich (ha!)You might also like2Embed
