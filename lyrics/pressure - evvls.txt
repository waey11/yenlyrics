3 Contributorsâ€‹pressure - evvls Lyrics[Intro]
(You have no heart)
Lets go, haha

[Verse 1]
You only love me when you see me winning, leave me 'lone
They saying that I'm Hollywood, when I'm just staying on my phone
Shawty asked if I can call back, I can't I'm in my zone
I can't leave it, bad bitch, I might see it
I might get her number, when I'm bored I'll just delete it, yeah
I shop when I'm bored, so my accountants oversee it
Her heart was too convenient, luckily I read it through
Really thought I needed you, that's cap
What make me feel better, it's going to my page, looking at stacks
You a rat boy you so broke, do you want some cheese or sumn?
You hit me when you needed some
Your bitch up all on me, just sumn (really something)

[Verse 2]
Niggas getting broker everyday, yeah
Check his IG posts, he don't show face, yeah
Hide behind them dreads bitch, we know you depressed bitch
Handle the pressure, give that boy a Nesquik (Nesquik)
Niggas getting broker everyday, yeah
Check his IG posts, he don't show face, yeah
Hide behind them dreads bitch, we know you depressed bitch
Handle the pressure, give that boy a Nesquik (Nesquik)
Nigga got a neck beard like he in his 30's
Man not getting bitches 'cause his dreads are too dirty
Nigga got his skinny jeans, can't keep walking
Why this nigga keep dropping?
All them bitches keep floppingYou might also likeEmbed
