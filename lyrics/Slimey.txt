2 ContributorsSlimey Lyrics[Intro]
(you have no heart)
Yeah, yeah yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I thought you heard bout my ego
I cannot fuck with these people
Nigga try copy and paste me
But it never gone be me though
Got a little Spanish hoe on me
She gettin' wet every sceno
I get to my bag like it's cheetos
This can get slimey like sito

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fuck, i just wanna talk
Nigga keep talkin' shit lay off the rocks
But if he keep on talkin' he die in a box
Stop trying to bе something you're not

[Verse 3]
Niggas gone starе at a block when it's hot
I don't gotta slide
I'm not none of my opps I just say "lookin' pretty"
I'm be in Houston like Whitney
The gas it got me a lil dizzy

I'm tired of all these niggas and bitches on god (on god)
My niggas ain't never lie to me, still doin' fraud (on god)
Look at my pockets, lil nigga this shit is a lot (shit is a lot)
Bad foreign bitch got my song in her playlist now she wanna come to the spot (woah)Embed
