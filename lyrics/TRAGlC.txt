2 ContributorsTRAGlC Lyrics[Intro]
How much would it hurt just to hear me out? (just hear me out)
Trip up in these verses, just hear me out
Withdrawals aye, B keep sending missed calls
Love these hoes from a distance, I miss-
(You have no heart)
(Kkei)

[Verse]
How much would it hurt just to hear me out? (just hear me out)
Trip up in these verses, just hear me out
Withdrawals aye, we keep sending missed calls
Love these hoes from a distance, I miss you
Number 9, I go forward
Feel like Mеssi back in '14
Cash really growing (yeah, yeah)
Bought a bag just to show mе
Ash on this Rick Owens tee'
Oh you're mad?
See what happens when I got you on my mind

[Outro]
That shit is tragic, yeah
That shit is tragic
Yeah, that shit is tragicYou might also likeEmbed
