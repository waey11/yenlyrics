Bitch, what you tryna tell me?
I remember that you kept tryna

[Verse]
I remember that you kept tryna tell me
Kept tryna tell me, I'm movin' unhealthy
I wish hearin' somethin' like that would've helped me
But like how could you help? I'm a different type of helpless
I knew you never felt me but I never told you
I let it drown in Henny, codeine in my stomach
Got a nigga feelin' heavy
I shoot no ball, nigga, ain't no hеsi
Just fucked up a pretty thot, now that ho my bestiе
Would've gave you the world if you let me
I would've gave you the world if you let me, If you let me be
Yeah, sometimes I would rather be alone
Yeah, sometimes I stay away from my phones
Yeah, sometimes I wonder if she the one
All this ganja on me got me higher than the sun
Backwoods in my lungs, put these pills on my tongue
Now these pinks got me numb
I-I'm off these pinks, they got me numbYou might also likeEmbed
