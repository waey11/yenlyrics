I did my time, I'm ready to leave it here (The mock of the year sits on a table)
(gunshot)
Oh,Oh,Oh
Oh,Oh,Oh

[Verse]
I did my time, I'm ready to leave it here(The mock of the year sits on a table)
Then again, I could be right, enough for me to stay (Decorated by the paintings of the youthful)
The karma takes its toll (Elation takes its hold)
I guess I'm lame and old , I'm tired of a few things(And I feel it for the first time)
I wonder what that's likeYou might also likeEmbed
