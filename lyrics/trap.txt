2 Contributors​trap Lyrics[Chorus]
He get jugged if he wanna (if he wanna)
She said she fell in love with marijuana (marijuana)
We gon' hot box yo' crib like it's a sauna
Posted in that big black coupe like I'm Obama
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Please just cut the act boy, you is not no trap nigga
Ain't no trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Please just quit the act nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Ain't no trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga

[Verse]
And I'm posted wit' my runts, I swear that's my only gang bitch
Baby flying out, I think shawty came from Cambridge
Niggas used to hate, now look at me, I became this
I came a long way from my face up in the pavement
Don't remind me, bitch I made it
Shawty got her phone up in my face, she tryna get famous
I been 27, and I'll nеver fucking say shit
And I'm in the money cult, all my niggas movе in sanction

[Chorus]
He get jugged if he wanna (if he wanna)
She said she fell in love with marijuana (marijuana)
We gon' hot box yo' crib like it's a sauna

Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Please just cut the act boy, you is not no trap nigga
Ain't no trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Not a trap nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Please just quit the act nigga, you is not no trap nigga
Ain't no trap nigga, you is not no trap niggaYou might also likeEmbed
