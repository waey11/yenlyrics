3 Contributors​​boy’s a liar Lyrics[Verse]
Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
You don't want no strings attached, girl, I'll give you what you need
If you don't do that love shit, baby, get up on your knees
I don't wanna argue, you can check your shit on read
You say that I'm lying, girl, I don't know what you need, but
It takes one to know one, girl your crying’s not enough
Under the impression that what we had was real love
I’ve been a side n***a too, I think I’ve seen enough

[Chorus]
Yeah, these hoes be lying
These hoes be lying
These hoes be lying
Girl I see right through that shit
These hoеs be lying
Yeah, thesе hoes be lying
So don’t even try it
Girl I see right through that shit
(See right through that shit)
(See right through that shit)
(Girl I see right through that shit)
Don't try it, don't try it
At first I'll stay quiet
Don't play stupid with me, hoe
I will fucking leave you

Girl I see right through that shit
These hoes be lying
Yeah, these hoes be lying
So don’t even try it
Girl I see right through that shit
(See right through that shit)
(See right through that shit)
(Girl I see right through that shit)
Don't try it, don't try it
At first I'll stay quiet
Don't play stupid with me, hoe
I will fucking leave you
