Damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn

[Verse]
All this Ganja 'round me stink
Roll a blunt up on his face
Swear these niggas is so lame
They ain't get out of my range
I hate it when you look around when I'm in front of you
I really need you ten toes down, they can only lie to you
Baby this a interlude
We on the wrong timing, yeah
Girl, you know I pick and choose but tonight is what we finna do
I swear you're trollin at times
It's sumn that you can't get out
It's some shit, can't back down
I said anything bout that oxy

[Verse 2]
Yeah
It's just me and this spliff
It's just me and this spliff
Crash out, designer
I think she fine now
Damn bad timing
Hope this money get my time up
Hoes want- Hoes want
Wish wе had no ties, ho
Always gotta remind her
I wouldn't likе it
Y'all don't even know me
Always gotta remind her

Yuh, fell in love
Fell in love with Codeine
