(Hey, glumboy) Sheesh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(You have no heart!)

[Chorus]
Making this money like yolo (Yolo)
Your bitch is in all of my photos (Photos)
Hop in a 2, not a 4 door
You talkin' crazy, don't hear a sound
I'm making money, they hear me now
[?] money count
I'm just tryna make my momma proud (Sheesh)
Making this money like yolo (Yolo)
Your bitch is in all of my photos (Photos)
Hop in a 2, not a 4 door
You talkin' crazy, don't hear a sound
I'm making money, they hear me now
[?] money count
I'm just tryna make my momma proud

[Verse]
Starting from the bat, you was clowning, now look where I'm at
Went from getting dumb, to getting hoes, cause yeah I'm in my bag
Said she want it, yeah, [?]
Got nothin' to fear
Only fifteen with the Rolex
Wait though, I got a lot on my plate yo
Happy I'm stackin' this cake tho
I'm movin' my pounds just like Play-Doh
That boy [?]
He turnin' crazy, case closed
Fifteen, gettin' pesos
Gon get a milly then lay low
They like "Ay where you at?"
"Makin' this money"
My pockets green, and yours lookin' bummy
Not making bands, gotta wait for me
Talkin' that shit, boy you a dummy
Pussy broke, not tryna be funny
I guess she got hard on my wave
Make gwuap every day
I'm in my bag, don't care what you say
You might also like[Chorus]
Making this money like yolo (Yolo)
Your bitch is in all of my photos (Photos)
Hop in a 2, not a 4 door
You talkin' crazy, don't hear a sound
I'm making money, they hear me now
[?] money count
I'm just tryna make my momma proud (Sheesh)
Making this money like yolo (Yolo)
Your bitch is in all of my photos (Photos)
Hop in a 2, not a 4 door
You talkin' crazy, don't hear a sound
I'm making money, they hear me now
[?] money count
I'm just tryna make my momma proud
Making this money like yolo (Yolo)
Your bitch is in all of my photos (Photos)
Hop in a 2, not a 4 door
You talkin' crazy, don't hear a sound
I'm making money, they hear me now
[?] money count
I'm just tryna make my momma proud
