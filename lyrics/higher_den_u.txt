i think this is better
[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Catch me higher than you, than you
Huh, huh

[Verse]
You can catch me far away getting higher than you
You could catch me far away
Getting higher than you
Than you, than you, than you
That bitch told you that she love you, but she lied to you
Ay, yuh
To you, and you, and you
I think he going out bad, cause I'm dying to shoot, ay shoot
Ay, yuh
Like what would you do
I just got it out the way bruh
Running, killing, danger
I be smashing blues
Type shit that you ?
I fucked up these new shoes,
Rick owens I skate them,
Beat that pussy say who you?
My old hoes I hate them
I hate them, I hate them, hate them, I hate y'all
[Outro]
