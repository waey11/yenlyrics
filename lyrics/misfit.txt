(Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ha, ha)

[Verse]
Shot up by elastic, went 0 straight to 10
Know some niggas, gotta @ me just to impress a friend
I′ve been faking it since last year
My life is make pretend
I just hide behind my gas
Bitch I always keep my pen
N***as think this shit is tragic
You should see my wrists, bitch
Crawling through these halls
Viewed as just another misfit
For years, until these n***as saw a blue check, and then clicked it
(Like damn I really miss shit)
(Before I wasn't in shit)
But I was always in shit
Ever since an infant
I′ve always been a fuck up
Been trouble in an instant
So I decide to fuck up my wrists, y'all never listened
To this day I still be cutting
I disregard the writ
Get me started on the bitches
I swear I didn't fucking care
She came into my life
Hope she don′t leave me, I′m so fucking scared
Like damn thats my problem
Ripping out my fucking hair
For shit that didn't even happen
Bitch I′m getting worried
I'm smoking gas to just be happy
