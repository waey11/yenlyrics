2 ContributorsFog Lyrics[Verse]
Had to handle my shit dolo
Now i'm with snowbunnies like yolo
Backseat in that stolo
Now we whippin to that [?]
She passed out off the mollys
But i sit there asking for more though
To pour up in my lean for real
Put that shit in my, soda
This bitch sittin here,with my blunt n shit
That’s just how you get blown n shit
It's original,nigga  just lettin' you know this shit

Lookin at me like damn nigga where yo ass been?
That’s the first nigga, i dont even know, that let you in
I see that guilt in your eyes thinkin something you did
Watch that shit all over, [?]
New margiela on me
Who stuntin like this?

Ever since a kid I never had no mercy
Juggin cellphones juggin bitches purses
I got my lifе,  percy
All the controversy
Pеrc got me turnin
Get this money earnin
Gettin rich and wise
I done sabotaged
This really tragic how this shit rideYou might also likeEmbed
