9 Contributorsâ€Žtylenol Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey
You have no heart

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the cash
Can you just keep it a stack?
You only want me for the racks
She only want me for the movement
I run up my check, like let's do it
I know your girlfriend listen to my music
I got my check and I run right through it
They hit me up, they like how do you do it

[Verse]
Show me your vision, she tryna convince me
Her love gets me pissed off, you better miss me with that shit
Show me your vision, she tryna convince me
Her love gets me pissed off, you better miss me with that shit (Bitch, bitch, bitch)

[Bridge]
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Ty-ty-ty
I need some Tylenol

I fell in love with the cash
Can you just keep it a stack?

She only want me for the movement
I run up my check, like let's do it

I got my check and I run right through it
They hit me up, they like how you do it
