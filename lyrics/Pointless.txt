2 ContributorsPointless Lyrics[Chorus]
Deep down in my mind
I know I'm not alright
Every day I walk through and say that I'm fine
You just wouldn't understand
Suffering from damage she put me through
But I owe you one
I don't know I'm still standing
I'm so clueless, what's the point of this?
The point of me and you

Deep down in my mind
I know I'm not alright
Every day I walk through and say that I'm fine
You just wouldn't understand it
Suffering from damage, she put me through
But I owe you one
I don't know how I'm still standing
I'm so Clueless what's just the point of this
The point of me and youYou might also likeEmbed
