(You have no heart)

[Verse]
Hold my breath until my skin turns baby blue (Baby blue)
We got so carried away (We got so carried away), we got so carried away
Alone again, you're rotting in your room (Rotting in your room)
What else is there to do?
I'm leaving without you (I'm leaving without you)
I've seen every shade of blue (I've seen every shade of blue)
I'm leaving without you (I'm leaving without you)
I've seen every shade of blue (I've seen every shade of blue)You might also like1Embed
