4 Contributorsâ€‹u think im up Lyrics[Verse]
Pretty girl, broke her heart
But swear it wasn't part of the plan
Like Jaydes got the whole fam' worried
Mama still love them xans
I shoulda been signed out
Only still here for the fans
I'm seeing people I don't know
[?] out of the photo
Off of these drugs to distract myself
You think I'm up, I know bro
I put a X on my tongue, yeah
I can't even feel myself
Too much for my life, yeah
Maybe I need some help
Maybe I need some drank
Maybe I need some gas too
You better save yourself
Just go back to the last dudeYou might also likeEmbed
