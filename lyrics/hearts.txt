5 Contributors​hearts Lyrics[Intro]
She wanna call back, but I don't got her number saved
She think she all that, really she can't stay away from me
One sided conversations
Her room gon' end up vacant
What I'm saying is

[Chorus]
She gon' run outta love
I'm not showing enough
I don't got the time for her
She gon' run outta love
Told her she doin' too much
Focusing on my fashion
At least I told you what's up
She gon' run outta love
I'm not showing enough
I don't got the time for her
She gon' run outta love
Told her she doin' too much
Focusing on my fashion
At least I told you what's up

[Verse]
You said I'm getting too cold
Look at you, what do you know?
Guess y'all can't opt in my mindset
Guess that's just how it goes
I get my monеy and flip it
You in the trap? No, you doin' your dishes
I'm with your bitch and she don't know my first namе
Might as well break up with her for good riddance
She just hit me up she sayin' "Jaydes, I like your voice, and shit"
I know that she want me and I like the way she's voicing it
I told shawty I don't know cause I'm just making noise and shit
End of the day I'm getting paid to make noise-
(Bitch)
You might also like[Chorus]
She gon' run outta love
I'm not showing enough
I don't got the time for her
She gon' run outta love
Told her she doin' too much
Focusing on my fashion
At least I told you what's up
She gon' run outta love
I'm not showing enough
I don't got the time for her
She gon' run outta love
Told her she doin' too much
Focusing on my fashion
At least I told you what's up

[Outro]
She gon' run outta love
At least I told you what's up
She gon' run outta loveEmbed
