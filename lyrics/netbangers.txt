5 Contributors​netbangers Lyrics[Intro: Jaydes]
(—made this one)
Grown ass man tryna clown me for being born in '06 yet I still have more money than you, nigga, you clowning me for being young, bro, what the fuck wrong with you?

[Verse 1: Jaydes]
I'm in Mexico with Dro, smoking on this dope
'Net bangers, talking hella shit until we kick the doors
Question that, how you got them ties? Bitch, I'm from the 4
We gon' jugg his spot and take the bands, then we finna roll
Nigga talking crazy, you my lil' bro, better chill out
Five .40s mixed with forty-nine gon' bring the thrill out
Two thousand mixed with '06 gon' bring a lil' drought
Niggas hit me up from elementary for a lil' clout
Keep singing, bitch, you know all the words, bitch, I know you know me
I heard you flagging, now you gon' die, Obi Wan Kenobi
Checking all my pockets, full of green, fucking guacamole
Niggas asking, "How the fuck you Evvls if your flow so holy?"
You want smoke? We could meet at Regal if you bring a camera
Flash, flash, boom, pow, that's the end of your lil' era (Oh shit!)
You was in my comments like some paper, all my niggas tear 'em
Seen him in the streets, take his clothes, all my niggas wear 'em

[Verse 2: Tae Retro]
Wait, I think I understand it
Why this nigga bragging 'bout his ho, he need higher standards
When I drop a track, they run it back, I'm Barry Sanders
You can't cross me like AI because I'm the answer
Nigga with attitude, I'm really ruthless like Eazy E
She ain't much, but the head decent, she pleasing me
Really apply force in the field, ain't no creasing me
In the booth, I really lose control, no decency
Evvls really evil in the booth, I'm rather holy
Sorry, bro, ain't know that was your ho, nobody told me
Niggas acting weird, that's why I prefer to be by my lonely
I'll bend backwards for the paper, you'll never fold me
If it ain't 'bout the money, I can't hear it, let's keep it cordial
Nigga tried to battle with a god, he a mere mortal
Always stay different from the rest, I'm never normal
Killing beats, grab the suit and tie, let's make it formalYou might also likeEmbed
