3 Contributors​​problems LyricsLyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
(You have no heart)

[Verse 1]
Cooling by myself, like, what's the problem with that?
Fell in love with wealth, like, what's the problem with that?
And he think that he finessing, we should rob him for that
Hit a stain on her nigga, now she calling me back
If you love me is it wrong?
She didn't know that I was on, now she know I'm on
I guess niggas looking up to me now
Niggas getting scared to say what's up to me now
She go from stuck up to a slut when a new [?] come around
Envy in your heart, you only up when I'm down
Nigga please stop playing like you up, you a clownYou might also likeEmbed
