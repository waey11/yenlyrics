You have no heart
Yeah, I still love you, you can't know that yet (Can't know that yet)
Your voice deteriorates in my head
I got no time to waste that's just lately (That's just lately)
I got hoes I don't want in my bed
You know exactly what you're doing, uh
You know exactly what you're doing, yeah

[Verse]
She don't give a fuck (She don’t give a fuck)
She broke my heart, but it got my money up (Got my money up)
And I think I smoke too much 'cause I can't run from you anymore
Behind closed doors I say, "Damn"
Can't believe you'd do this to me
She don't give a fuck (She don't give a fuck)
She broke my heart, but it got my money up (Got my money up)
And I think I smoke too much 'cause I can't run from you anymore
Behind closed doors I say, "Damn"

[Outro]
Behind closed doors I'm like, "Damn"
I swear that you're only here when you need me
I swear that you're only here when you need me
I swear that you're only here when you need me
