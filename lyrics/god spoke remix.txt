Bought that bitch some vivi', she a soldier, shoutout Dev
I remember I was down bad lettin’ bitches in my head
Now I got these hoes up in the trap helpin' me count my bread
Niggas wait for me to drop like Carti with Whole Lotta Red
Yeah yeah, yeah yuh
Uh-huh, yuh, ok
(You have no heart!)
Pfft, yuh yuh, uh

[Verse]
Your bitch know the word like she a preacher (like she a preacher)
Kick her out the crib ‘cause I don’t need her (I don’t need her)
I be stompin’ in these ricks ‘cause they my beaters (They my beaters)
I'ma fuck a bitch, act like I never seen her (Never seen her)

[Chorus]
Bought that bitch some vivi', she a soldier, shoutout Dev
I remember I was down bad lettin’ bitches in my head
Now I got these hoes up in the trap helpin' me count my bread
Niggas wait for me to drop like Carti with Whole Lotta Red

[Post-Chorus]
I’ve been juggin’ since a tot, too bad all these bitches they be bots  (all these bitches are some thots)
I’ve been juggin’ since a tot, too bad all these bitches they be bots  (all these bitches are some thots)
