(Archive, man we fuckin' with Fiji)
Ha, ha, ha, yeah
Ha, ha, ha
[Chorus]
She tryna, what
She tryna, what
She tryna fuck on me
Before I'm really in trouble
Bad bitch blew gas, she's talkin
Lotta guap, nigga that is my slogan
Deep past, nigga think that he know it
Locked in with the woods, got me focused
We is not locked in, nigga
I do not know you
I do not know you, ay

[Verse]
I stack my money, a flex
Just like I'm posed to
Just like I'm posed to
Just like I'm posed to
Damn man, I think I'm getting bored
Fuck these groupies

I just spent 3 bands, yeah

Balenciaga [?], on my pants
These niggas, still rocking Ksubi
[Chorus]
She tryna, what
She tryna, what
She tryna fuck on me
Before I'm really in trouble

Deep past, nigga think that he know it
Locked in with the woods, got me focused
We is not locked in, nigga
I do not know you, yeah
