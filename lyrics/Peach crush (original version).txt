You have no heart

[Chorus]
Is there something that you want from me? (You want from me?)
Girl, just tell me the deal
Leave roses on your neck, peach crush to down these pills
Fuck around in your bed
Tell me is this what you want from me? (You want from me?)

[Verse]
Baby show me how you feel
You’re stuck up in ya head and I’m tryna make it real
Tocando tu cintura bae, your body too ideal
You know that I want you, yeah, you always think I’m lying to you
Girl, you always think I'm lying to ya
Yeah, you always think I'm lying to you
You know I get tired of trying too

[Chorus]
Is there something that you want from me? (You want from me?)
Girl, just tell me the dеal
Leave roses on your nеck, peach crush to down these pills, fuck around in your bed
Tell me is this what you want from me? (You want from me?)You might also likeEmbed
