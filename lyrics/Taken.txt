1 ContributorTaken Lyrics[Intro: jaydes]
Bag a bitch, I feel like my name Mace
And you smokin' on that blunt but that shit laced
Wit' a white bitch on my body but she taken
She keep on callin' me her lover boy, no Drake
Mr.-
(You have no heart!)
Bih
(Plug)

[Chorus: jaydes]
Mr. Bag a bitch, I feel like my name Mace
And you smokin' on that blunt but that shit laced
Wit' a white bitch on my body but she taken
She keep on callin' me her lover boy, no Drake

Mr. Bag a bitch, I feel like my name Mace
And you smokin' on that blunt but that shit laced
Wit' a white bitch on my body but she taken
She keep on callin' me her lover boy, no Drake

[Verse 1: jaydes]
It is what it is, man you can't change that
I'ma need a K for a lil' feature
I might raise that
I been makin' monеy, flexin' on you
It's no payback
Legally can't drive yеt
Still up in that Maybach

And she over and over
She gon' call me when she need me (Plug)
She want me back, I know she feenin'
And she gon' slide up "when we meetin'?"
All in my crib like "Where you be at?"
And she like "Please don't let 'em know"
Fuck that bitch then I delete her
Took that lil' boy girl, yeah that shit natural
The pack came in and it's stronger than international
I fuck these teens like it's [?] it ain't no average hoe
She said I'm going sad, I told her "bitch don't fuck my bankroll"Embed
