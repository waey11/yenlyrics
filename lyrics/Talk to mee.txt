1 ContributorTalk to mee Lyrics[Verse]
Talk to me girl
Talk to me baby
You're my whole damn world (talk to me)
Didn't really have a choice
Stuck in my trance once again
I know and I know you fucking hate me
Tell me about it (tell me about it)

Talk to me girl
Talk to me baby
You're my whole damn world (talk to me)
Didn't really have a choice
Stuck in my trance once again
I know and I know you fucking hate me
Tell me about it (tell me about it)

Talk to me girl
Talk to me baby
You're my whole damn world (talk to me)
Didn't really have a choice
Stuck in my trance once again
I know and I know you fucking hate me
Tell me about it (tell me about it)You might also likeEmbed
