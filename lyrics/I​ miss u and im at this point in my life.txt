I want your mind, can it break right through?
Can you give me a chance to stare at you?
Just one last time, you gotta hear it
It's our last dance, before we're through

[Chorus]
I want your mind, can it break right through?
Can you give me a chance to stare at you?
Just one last time, you gotta hear it
It's our last dance, before we're through

[Verse]
You weren't mine but that's okay and
It broke my heart when you couldn't stay
Just one last time, you gotta hear it
So much that I couldn't say

[Chorus]
I want your mind, can it break right through?
Can you give me a chance to stare at you?
Just one last time, you gotta hеar it
It's our last dance, before wе're through

[Outro]
I want your mind, can it break right through?
Can you give me the chance to stare at you?
Just one last time before you hear itYou might also likeEmbed
