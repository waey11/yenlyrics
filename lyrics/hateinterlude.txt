(You have no heart)
My bitches don't gotta lie to me
(Okay, I got it, thank you)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
This and that, baby, I know what I want
Roll a blunt, soak it in, make a song, say her name, now that shit her favorite song
If you really love me, what you hatin' on? (Ooh-ooh)
If you really love me, what you— (Hatin' on?)
If you really love me, what you hatin' on?

[Verse]
You said, "Please talk to me," I've been talkin' to you the whole time
You still movin' like you special, girl, you not alone
There's a whole line full of bad bitches with the whole nine
Hella baggage, you can't hold mine, but it's okay 'causе I hold mine
I've been movin' on my own time, baby, I'vе been movin' on my own time (On my own time)
Designer bags and Backwoods got her dreamin' (Got her dreamin')
It's always cold and that's in every season (Every season)
I'm on my own shit, why the fuck are you tweakin'? (Why are you like th—)
Hate run through your skin and bones, baby, I think that it's seepin'

[Chorus]
This and that, baby, I know what I want
Roll a blunt, soak it in, make a song, say her name, now that shit her favorite song
If you really love me, what you hatin' on? (Ooh-ooh)
If you really love me, what you— (Hatin' on?)
Really love me, what you hatin' on?
Really love me, what you hatin' on?
Really love me, what you hatin' on? Huh
