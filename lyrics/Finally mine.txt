Finally mine bae, you finally mine
And I haven't been this happy in a long time
Finally mine bae, you finally mine

[Verse 1: jaydes]
Shit has been real funny, ever since I ran my money up
Bitches that was dubbin' me, now want me, 'cause I'm comin' up
Said she want a d'estree bag
It's not a hoe, I'm chasing green
I swear to god these bitches really want me
Cannot get up on me, they on me, they feenin'
I'm makin' money, I'll still drive by your spot
Say you make money, but your shit aboutta flop
He talking shit, so we make sure his body drop
I'm growin' up, but I'm still gon' be swipin' cards
Still the same nigga, I'm not gonna change
Only 14, but I'll still make it rain
Fuck wit' my clique, All these niggas be lame
Now, I'ma just wait for the money and fame

I'ma fuck the world without a magnum
All I need is paper, that bitch plastic
Smoking a whole tank, I gotta ash it

Rolled up to his block, put him in casket-
I don't give a fuck, I'm kinda savage
My bro foreign walk, I'm finna crash it
Think at 12 O'clock I gotta dash quick

Just copped a new jacket
And I step, it's dapper
He asked me "What's cracking?"
I said "Nothing matters"
