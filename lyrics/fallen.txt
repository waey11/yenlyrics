[Verse]
Ay, I'm inna court room with full Rick denim on
I'm jus glad that shit over
Out before I was supposed to be
Shit jus really not the same no more
I lost a lot of niggas that was close to me
Yuh, I was off the pills I'm fiending for your dopamine
And you steady asking why you can't get close to me
At this point dont worry about nun, smoke this ganja and get comfortable
You know my love get bloody
You know my love get bloody
You know my cup get muddy, ion fuck with anybody
Take my word for granted then you must not know about meYou might also likeEmbed
