1 ContributorLatelyy Lyrics[Chorus]
I love my commas 'cause they never did me wrong
It seems like more guap, less trust
Niggas getting faker
Not nothing that I haven't seen
It used to trigger anger

(H- H-)
(Hold up DJ Phat, why are you not answering?)
(Kkei)

[Verse 1]
More guap, less trust
More gas lately
(You have no heart!)
More guap, less trust
More gas lately
I'm gone, but still the same me, crazy (D- D- D- D- DJ Phat)

[Verse 2]
She think 'cause she pretty she could fuck me for my name
But it's just really 'cause I feel like еntertaining
I don't want your problems
Pretty girl, you see yoursеlf
In my songs sometimes I'm looking for drama
Know I got that from my Moms
And I really love my commas 'cause they never did me wrong
You might also like[Chorus]
I love my commas 'cause they never did me wrong
It seems like more guap, less trust
Niggas getting faker
Not nothing that I haven't seen
It used to trigger anger
(H- H- Hoodrich!)

[Verse 3]
More guap, less trust
More gas lately
More guap, less trust
More gas lately
I'm gone, but still the same me, crazy
(Like damn DJ Ph-)
More guap, less trust
More gas lately
More guap, less trust
More gas lately
I'm gone, but still the same me, crazy

[Outro]
She think 'cause she pretty she could fuck me for my name
But it's just really 'cause I feel like entertaining
I don't want your problemsEmbed
