Hauntin' the neighborhood, how did I end up here?
Think I came from up there, oh, why am I stuck here?
I think I'll leave early, before it gets ugly
I rather be no one, don't ask me what happened
Act like it don't hurt me, so it never matters
So it never matters, I'll act like it don't hurt, so it never matters
(So it never matters)
