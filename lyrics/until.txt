[Intro]
Woah
Woah
Yeah, (woah, yeah)
Woah

[Verse]
Everything was going just fine
Until you started talking, ′bout her again
I think it's better off, that we friends
Where were you at when I needed you?
Woah
Guess it′s too late for the positives, (yeah, woah)
(I needed that)

[Part II]

[Verse]
Cut's on my hands, I can't hold yours
I feel stripped of my skin, and alone
Tell me, what happened to me?
I′m facing the pavement, look what you made me do
Cut′s on my hands, I can't hold yours, (hold yours)
I feel stripped of my skin, and alone
Something must happen to me
Tell me why
I′m facing the pavеment, look what you made me do

Oh, look what you madе me do, (blame it on the rain outside)
Oh, look what you made me do, (blame it on the cracks on the floor)
Oh, look what you made me do, (blame it on me)
Oh, look what you made me doEmbed
