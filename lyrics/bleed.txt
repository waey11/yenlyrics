[Intro]
(You have no heart)

[Chrous]
Yeah, down like 500 mgs
It gets cold like 5 degrees
She take percs to cheer her up
Bad bitch take like 5 a week
Since a jit ain't give a fuck
Franco jugged a pound of weed
He just trappin', 'til he up
Might go to LA just to leave
She scared I'm not waking up
I smoked too much now I can't breathe
At least there's nothing in my cup
She love me but I'm out of reach
She love me but I'm MIA
Like hoe I'm trying, watch me bleed
Watch my family lose power

[Verse]
Who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Another bag, I'll hold this tight
Cuz losing you, it made me bank
Said "Jaydes, like why the fuck you bored?"
What the fuck I'm 'posed to say?
She hate when I'm MIA
And barely posting on my page
My phone carries all my sins
So I been screaming fuck the fame

[Chrous]
Yeah, down like 500 mgs
It gets cold like 5 degrees
She take percs to cheer her up
Bad bitch take like 5 a week
Since a jit ain't give a fuck
Franco jugged a pound of weed
He just trappin', 'til he up
Might go to LA just to leave
She scared I'm not waking up
I smoked too much now I can't breathe
At least there's nothing in my cup
She love me but I'm out of reach
She love me but I'm MIA
Like hoe I'm trying, watch me bleed
Watch my family lose power

[Outro]
Who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
Take control of me
Like, who gon take control of me? (take control of me)
