4 Contributors​weird​ Lyrics[Verse]
I let you flip your hair in my face
I let you flip your hair in my face
I let you flip your hair in my face
I let you flip your hair in my face
I'm so weird for you
I'm so weird for you
I'm so weird for you
I wanna do what you want me to
Twenty-seven days until I break
And I can't tell the difference between real or mistake
I let you flip your hair in my face
I let you flip your hair in my face
I let you flip your hair in my face
I let you flip your hair in my face
I'm so weird for you
I'm so weird for you
I'm so weird for you
I wanna do what you want me to
Twenty-seven days until I break
And I can't tell the difference between real or mistakeYou might also likeEmbed
