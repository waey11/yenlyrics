Kimi jugging pints
If you love me I might wanna love for the night
When I land off this flight
On the way, I'm outside
She said pour me up
I call her my Henny queen
She said, "Jaydes you put me on" (bitch)
Issey Miyake your jeans
All this money got me distant
The drugs it got me sleeping
Pretty hoe gon' pop a xan
Now she think she on Venus

[Chorus]
Kimi jugging pints
If you love me I might wanna love for the night
When I land off this flight
On the way, I'm outside
She said pour me up
I call her my Henny queen
She said, "Jaydes you put me on" (bitch)
Issey Miyake your jeans
All this money got me distant
The drugs it got me sleeping
Pretty hoe gon' pop a xan
Now she think she on Venus
I don't t-t-t-try no more
Way too undefea-
(I'm way too undefea-)You might also likeEmbed
