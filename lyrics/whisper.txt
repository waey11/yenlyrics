2 ContributorsWhisper Lyrics[verse]
When you whisper
When you whisper to me (i feel)
But you think you're alone tonight
But you think you're alone (you think you're alone)

[Chorus]
What are these issues you're running from again
Somethings telling me you need somebody to hold (someone to hold)
It's getting old

[verse]
When you whisper
When you whisper to me (i feel)
But you think you're alone tonight
But you think you're alone (you think you're alone)

[outro]
What are these issues you're running from again
Somethings telling me you need somebody to hold (someone to hold)
It's getting old (whisper to me)You might also likeEmbed
