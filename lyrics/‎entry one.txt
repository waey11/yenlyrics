These cuts on my wrist, they ripe I swear 'cause they sometimes make me better
Dying just to see you again so I'm tired of writing letters to you
Can't express myself, I always choke on my own words
Can't explain what's going on, all I know is that it hurts
I can't do this no more without you
Baby you're my rose, without you—
Regret, all I cared and loved you
But I fucked it up and now I gotta hurt
Lost the only thing I loved
Completely was my fault
Myself I can't keep safe
You know it's all my fault because you didn't have a say in it
I fuck everything up, but I'm just so tired of saying it
If you were here you'd be disappointed, but I can't sing to no one else
And I swear I'm just so tired that I might just kill myselfYou might also likeEmbed
