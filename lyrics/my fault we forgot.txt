10 Contributorsâ€‹my fault we forgot Lyrics[Intro]
Told you
Yeah

[Chorus]
I would've told you before all of this, but I didn't
I'm looking for somebody to kiss (Somebody to kiss)
Chemical straight into my brain
Tell me, baby, am I going insane? (Going insane)
Do you love or do you really just want me to rot?
I said your name to myself so many times, I forgot (Bleh)
I said your name to myself so many times, I forgot
Name to myself so many times, I forgot
Goth

[Chorus]
I would've told you before all of this, but I didn't
I'm looking for somebody to kiss (Somebody to kiss)
Chemical straight into my brain
Tell me, baby, am I going insane? (Going insane)
Do you love or do you really just want me to rot? (Tell me, baby, am I going insane?)
I said your name to myself so many times, I forgot (Bleh) (Goth) (Tell me, tell me, baby, am I going insane?)
I said your name to myself so many times, I forgot (Tell me, tell me, baby, am I going insane?)
Name to myself so many times, I forgot (Tell me, tell me, baby, am I going insane?)You might also likeEmbed
