(muffled vocals)

[Chorus]
And I can't get you out (of my brain)
Voices getting too loud
I can't even believe myself anymore
All these drugs on the floor
And my room keep getting smaller
I can't do this much longer
And I can't get you out (of my brain)
Voices getting too loud
I can't even believe myself anymore
All these drugs on the floor
And my room keep getting smaller
I can't do this much longer


[Outro]
And I can't get you out (of my brain)
Voices getting too loud
I can't even believe myself anymore
All these drugs on the floor
And my room keep getting smaller
I can't do this much longerYou might also likeEmbed
