6 ContributorsUBER XL REMIX Lyrics[Intro: jaydes]
(You have no heart)
Ooh, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Jaydes]
We just slid to Brooklyn, Uber, we was too geeked
Bitch, I'm tryna see you, don't know what you did to me
Bae, don't ask no questions, don't worry about her
Niggas showin' true colors, gas gettin' louder
Backwoods got me back to normal
Can't make me jealous, just viewed as a ho now, hey
"I see you sellin' out shows now, Jay"
All of that money, you still not okay
Still feelin' alone, twin in that Scat, you know what we on
Like, what's in this pack? (Like, what's in this pack?)
I'm smokin' on strong, like, bae, where you at?

[Interlude: BABYXSOSA]
Hmm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm (Surf gang, baby)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Hmm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

I pull up to Brooklyn, Uber L was too thick
I don't ask no questions, send me the location
Walk up, I see my bro
In pink pants with no ho
All these niggas on the block
I say, "Marco," you say, "Polo"
Before I even touch down
Had to knock a bitch right out
I'm with Surf Gang right now
We don't do no questions now
I say, "Marco," you say, "Polo"
I'm with Surf Gang now1Embed
