Searching through all the lies only you can see
Movin' through all my pride to what's true to me
Wanna move all the grass, this is new to me
Damn I miss my headache
Damn I miss my headache
(Damn I miss my headache)
(Miss my, oh, miss my headache)
(Damn I miss my headache)
(Yeah, ya, ya, ya, yeah, ya, ya, ya, yeah, ya, ya, yeah, ya, ya, ya, yeah)
(Ya, ya, yeah, ya, ya, ya, yeah, ya)
