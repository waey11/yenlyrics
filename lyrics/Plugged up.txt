3 ContributorsPlugged up Lyrics[Intro]
Shut the fuck up, bro
Shut the fuck up
C-c-crewbeatz, hoe
Evil empire
Evil empire is the label

[Chorus]
B- Bitch I'm too plugged up
Niggas got me fucked up
Bitch I'm from the fo', all my niggas from the mud bro
Ima knock up on yo' door, (fa fa fa) that's a thud bro
All you niggas are so bitch, and you afraid to run yo' 1's bro

[Verse 1]
Yo' bitch said that she love me, whatever that means
The gang make seperations, bitch I feel like I'm Kashdami
Too many hoes, Ima change my number so my phone don't blow
Too many flows, too many poles this choppa came with fucking scopes
???
Yo bitch on me, putting her hands up in my pants
Nigga be talking that shit, I'm the one who was putting you on, niggas don't understand
You like to run yo' mouth but you can't run thеm hands

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm too plugged up
Niggas got me fucked up
Bitch I'm from thе fo', all my niggas from the mud bro
Ima knock up on yo' door, (fa fa fa) that's a dub bro
All you niggas are so bitch, and you afraid to run yo' 1's bro
Bitch I'm too plugged up
Niggas got me fucked up
Bitch I'm from the fo', all my niggas from the mud bro
Ima knock up on yo' door, (fa fa fa) that's a dub bro
All you niggas are so bitch, and you afraid to run yo' 1's bro
Yo' bitch said that she love me, whatever that meansYou might also likeEmbed
