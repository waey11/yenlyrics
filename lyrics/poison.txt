12 Contributorsâ€‹poison Lyrics[Chorus]
I'll be your poison
I'll take you out of that head of yours
I feel you deep in my skin
I can't let you in
But you're what I need
You're what I need

[Verse]
Falling deep in your poison (You have no heart)
I'm falling deep in your poison
I'm falling deep in your poison
Everything in me craves your touch
It's just you me and these swishers
And calls that I won't pick up
You complain about him so cut him out the picture

[Chorus]
I'll be your poison
I'll be your poison
I'll take you out of that head of yours
I feel you deep in my skin
I can't let you in
But you're what I need
You're what I need
Falling deep in your poison
I'm falling deep in your poisonYou might also likeEmbed
