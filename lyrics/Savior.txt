5 ContributorsSavior Lyrics[Intro: jaydes]
(I love DJ Phat)
Now this hoe think imma save her
She do this all the time
Jaydes christ is not your savior
Got too much on my mind (I got too much on my m-)
You won't understand- Bitch, haha
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
You won't understand me if I try to tell you
So I'd rather just not
(DJ Phat, Fuck these niggas up) (you have no heart)

[Chorus: jaydes]
You won't understand me if I try to tell you
So I'd rather just not (I'd rather just not)
You won't understand me if I try to tell you
So I'd rather just not (I'd rather just not)
Just focus on the plot
Hoe I'm posted in my Miami
Gas in my wood, and my pockets full of guap
500 for a top, but spent 0 on his chain?
Tell my niggas get me right
You should watch how you behave
We won't rob you, but we might
Now this hoе think imma save her
She do this all thе time
Jaydes christ is not your savior
Got too much on my mind (I got too much on my m-)
(D- D- D- D- D- D- DJ Phat)

Just focus on the plot

Gas in my wood, and my pockets full of guap
500 for a top, but spent 0 on his chain?
I tell my niggas "Get me right"
You should watch how you behave
We won't rob you but we might
Now this hoe think imma save her
She do this all the time
Jaydes christ is not your savior
Got too much on my mind (I got too much on my m-)
