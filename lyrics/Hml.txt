2 ContributorsHml Lyrics[Chorus]
(Yeah)
I think she's my type, I need her number (You have no heart!)
Stuck up in my mind, small waist, she's so fine
Tell her hit my line, tell her come over
I won't waste your time

(Yeah)
I think she's my type, I need her number (You have no heart!)
Stuck up in my mind, small waist, she's so fine
Tell her hit my line, tell her come over
I won't waste your time

[Verse]
Let me treat your ight, yeah
You way too pretty for you just to stay a night, yeah
Lеt me focus on my bands
Just wanna get right wit' you
Even though I'm off thе drugs
I wanna spend time wit' you
This a soft summer, I'll still pop a nigga (pop that nigga)
Born in '06, but I'll still rock that nigga (rock that nigga)
Old friends be acting like some goofy's had to drop them niggas
Talking crazy on the gang, they robbed the nigga (robbed that nigga)
He got jugged
You might also like[Chorus]
(Yeah)
I think she's my type, I need her number
Stuck up in my mind, small waist, she's so fine
Tell her hit my line, tell her come over
I won't waste your time

(Yeah)
I think she's my type, I need her number
Stuck up in my mind, small waist, she's so fine
Tell her hit my line, tell her come over
I won't waste your time
