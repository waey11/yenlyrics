13 Contributorsâ€Žvivienne Lyrics[Chorus]
(You have no heart)
Yeah, why you toying with my fucking brain? Woah
All these other girls, are not the same, woah
All these women borin' me
They can't love you like I do, why are you ignoring me? Yeah
(Silo killed this shit)

[Post-Chorus]
I might spend my racks now
Just to fill the void, yeah
Everybody's watching
Gas got me exhausted
Thought I had your heart
But I guess I really lost it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
I be in that brand new Benz
I be high like Peter Pan
She said since I'm on her playlist
Thought she might just bring a friend
Only hear my money countin
Don't really care about your comments
Got a problem with my clique?
Then best believe that we gon' solve it
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, why you toying with my fucking brain? Woah
All these other girls are not the same, woah
All these women borin' me
They can't love you like I do, why are you ignoring me? Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I might spend my racks now
Just to fill the void, yeah
Everybody's watching
Gas got me exhausted
Thought I had your heart
But I guess I really lost it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, why you toying with my fucking brain? Woah
All these other girls are not the same, woah
All these women bore me
They can't love you like I do, why are you ignoring me? Yeah

Yeah, why you toying with my fucking brain? Woah
All these other girls are not the same, woah
All these women bore me
They can't love you like I do, why are you ignoring me? Yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woah)Embed
