[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Smoke, molly, xan,
Whatchu need?

[Verse]
Smoke, molly, xan
Whatchu need?
Booted off this 30, off this bean
Smoke all the pound, I just flipped three
I wake up, get this cash up then repeat
Tell me- Tell me why you talking if it's not bout green
I'm like-I'm like every time I step up in the scene
I'm smoking on pressure I got pressure on me
Think you the one from my dreams, for real
With my bitch, she sip lean for real
Could've gave you the whole damn world,
But you want me to bleed for real
VVS diamonds with jade on my fangs, that's on my teeth for real
This cash how I speak for real
Told my gang we gon' eat for real
Smoke, molly, xan,
Whatchu need?
Booted off this 30, off this bean
Smoke all the pound, I just flipped three
I wake up, get this cash up then repeat
Tell me- Tell me why you talking if it's not bout green
