3 ContributorsStrain Lyrics[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Smoke, molly, xan, what you need?

[Chorus]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Smoke, molly, xan, what you need?
Booted off this 30, off this bean
Smoke all the pound I just flipped three
I wake up, get this cash out, then repeat
Tell me- Tell me, why you talkin' if its not bout green

[Verse]
Every time I step out in the scene
I'm smoking on pressure
I got pressure on me
Think you the one for my dreams, for real
You my bitch just to lean, for real
Could have gave you the whole damn world but you want me to bleed, for real
VVS diamonds with jade on my fangs, oh that's on my teeth, for real
This cash what I speak, for real
Told my gang we gon' eat, for real

[Chorus]
Smoke, molly, xan, what you need?
Booted off this 30, off this bean
Smoke all the pound I just flipped three
I wake up, get this cash out, then repeat
Tell me- Tell me, why you talkin' if its not bout greenYou might also likeEmbed
