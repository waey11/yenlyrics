Voices in my head again
My ultimatums made up
Stuck inside my bed again
I wanna pretend, but I can't anymore
(I've so far been questioning, but the days gone by, and I cannot decide what I—)
(Man, this shit is so dumb, I got people on my side, but for a while I've been done)
And it might sound cliche, but for a while I've been numb to it
