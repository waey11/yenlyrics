I said bitch
I said bitch
I said bitch
I said bitch
[Verse]
I'm tryna pop ya, I got everything you want
I got peeps left in 50 and it's kinda on my rock
I got Xanax for my dogs
I got Molly for my nympha
Jaydes Christ really one for the people
I'ma keep it real
I'ma keep it straight
You know I'm to real
I won't hesitate
I'ma get that kill
I'ma set it straight
Had to get my wings, had to fly away
Crashed in like magic, don't die today
Big, on me, big, money, shit
Said that's why I'm ready to die
I'm just here to suicide
Yeah I didn't give a shit, but I give blood
You're lucky this shit won't be tough
We done looked down my life
I know you don't wanna hear this shit
Because all this shit about to fuck you up
You can get your jugged out your life
That's why I'ma keep this shit talking
I'ma keep walking till you find me
Niggas, tryna be something
Niggas, tryna be something
Niggas, tryna be something
That they not, I'ma end that shit

[Outro]
I don't want you to die, i'ma bite ya
I don't want you to die, i'ma bite ya
I'ma bite ya, i'ma bite ya
I'ma bite yaYou might also likeEmbed
