3 ContributorsFitness Lyrics[Intro]
Can't let her know that she get in my head
All of you niggas is fake
If I had a choice, I'd rather be dead
She finna worry about me, 'cause I'm too high, but I'm counting the bread
Paranoid lil nigga with a lil stick on him, will get caught by the feds
I'm prolly finna jugg til a nigga-

[Verse]
You niggas not what I'm on, nobody touching me in this shit
Niggas was biting since I was a jit
Fuck it, I might get some clothes on my bitch
I'm on my own shit leave me alone
Bad asian bitch finna roll me a blunt
She tryna facetime, I'm in the zone
Can't let her know that she get in my head
Wait, All of these niggas is fake
If I had a choice, I'd rather be dead (yeah, yeah)
She finna worry about me, 'cause I'm too high, but I'm counting up bread
Paranoid lil nigga with a lil stick on him, will get caught by the feds
I'm prolly finna jugg til a nigga-
