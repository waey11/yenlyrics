16 Contributors​south Lyrics[Intro]
You have no heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ohissmcqueen)
Ayy, yeah, yeah (Hazard, you killed this)

[Chorus]
Too pretty to be trippin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
After all that, you lost my interest (Lost my interest)
Movin' fast, less time for forgiveness
All I know is get money, mind my business (Mind my business)
Still the same nigga from the South

[Verse]
Pack moving in by the ounce, in and out
Got it on deck while these niggas in a drought (While these niggas in a drought)
Can't talk if it ain't big amounts
Shit went South when you let it (Shit went South when you let it)
Even if that wasn't your intention (Think it's not your fault)
She said I've been distant, she don't know where my head is (Yeah, yeah)
She think about a groupie, get jealous (Get jealous)
Meanwhile, b— hit me up again, she missed me from the start, ayy (From the start)
Really not her fault, so I don't play with her heart (Play with her heart)
Really built for this shit, feel like Da Vinci with the art (Da Vinci with the art)
It's gettin' easy, think I'm made for it

[Bridge]
Gettin' paid to explain my all pains and shit
Really flexed up 'cause a nigga paid for it
My lil' brother in the Bronx, movin' dangerous
Dirty money, still paid and a young nigga
You might also like[Chorus]
Way too pretty to be trippin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
After all that, you lost my interest (Lost my interest)
Movin' fast, less time for forgiveness (Uh-huh)
All I know is get money, mind my business
Still the same nigga from the South (Same nigga from the South)
Still the same nigga from the South

[Outro]
