Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ha (Ha)

[Verse]
Shot up by elastic, went zero straight to ten
Now some niggas gotta at me, just to impress a friend
I been faking it since last year, my life is make pretend
I just hide behind my gas, bitch, I always keep my pen
Niggas think this shit is tragic, you should see my wrists bitch
Crawling through these halls, viewed as just another misfit
For years into these niggas saw a blue check and then clicked it
Like damn, I really miss it, before I wasn't in shit
But I was always in shit, ever since an infant
I've always been a fuck up, been trouble in an instant
So I decide to fuck up my wrists, I never listened
To this day I still be cutting I disregard the ri—
Get me started on the bitches, I swear I didn't fucking care
She came into my life, but she don't need me, I'm so fucking scared
Like damn that's my problem
Ripping out my fucking hair, for shit that didn't even happen
This shit getting wack, I'm smoking gas to just be happy

[Outro]
Da-da-da
