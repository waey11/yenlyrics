Was out of respect
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (It's Surreal Gang, lil' bitch)
You have no heart
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
I want my wrist on Cartier
Do I wanna get high with his bitch?
None of this shit was a surprise
Known since a jit, I was gon' be rich
Thirteen, I was trappin' through the school
I was skippin' class with my lil' ho
Think I seen her backstage at a show
Me and her, we rollin' fat
And she gettin' second hand from the smoke, ayy
Get my money, get more, ayy
Gang really love the 30's
He would kill a nigga for one of those, ayy
Pussy nigga not hard, lil' bro think he Chief Keef on the low, ayy
Niggas wanna be like jaydes, so it's all love when they steal my flow

[Chorus]
I want my wrist on Cartier
Do I wanna get high with his bitch?
None of this shit was a surprise
Known since a jit, I was gon' be rich
Thirteen, I was trappin' through the school
I was skippin' class with my lil' ho
Think I seen her backstage at a show
Me and her, we rollin' fat
And she gettin' second hand from the smoke, ayy
Get my money, get more, ayy
Gang really love the 30's
He would kill a nigga for one of those, ayy
Pussy nigga not hard, lil' bro think he Chief Keef on the low, ayy
Niggas wanna be like jaydes, so it's all love when they steal my flow
