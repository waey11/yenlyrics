3 Contributors​​suicides Lyrics[Intro]
(I really like to use cash)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You have no heart!)

[Chorus]
Yeah, moving good pack, it got me gone
How the fuck that nigga bitch in Saint Laurent?
That's my lil' flame in the 305
I can't trust these niggas 'cause it's do or die, yeah
Hoe I'm moving dolo, ain't no "You and I"
Pushing in that Benz coupe, I'm doing suicides, yeah
Pushing in that Benz coupe, I'm doing suicides
(Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr)

[Verse]
I just put some gold on my neck

[Chorus]
Yeah, moving good pack, it got me gone
How the fuck that nigga bitch in Saint Laurent?
That's my lil' flame in the 305
I can't trust these niggas 'cause it's do or die
Hoe I'm moving dolo, ain't no "You and I"
Pushing in that Benz coupe, I'm doing suicides yeah
Pushing in that Benz coupe, I'm doing suicides
(Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr)You might also likeEmbed
