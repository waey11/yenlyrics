She was my retribution 
The body’s decomposing 
She scratched me on my shoulder, but I told her we’re fine
Everything’s so pointless 
and everyones a loser
You need to hear it when you’re in need of your own life
My retributions gone
Shes just another blonde
Her cold and lifeless body was supposed to move on
Maybe I’m just joking
But maybe I’m not kidding
Id love to play pretend but all the kid in me is gone
Oh, [?]
Nobody’s gonna hear it when you scream
Oh, it’s so quiet
