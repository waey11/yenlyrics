Huh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh
(You have no heart)
Okay, pew

[Chorus]
Lookin' up to me could 'cause an issue ('Cause an issue)
I got cash and hella gas, like what's the issue? Ayy (What's the issue?)
Way too many hoes, I don't know if I miss you, ayy
Can't let pretty ho get makeup on my fit, ooh, ayy
And I put my ho in Raf Simons jeans (Raf Simons jeans)
I just took his ho 'cause he was bag fumbling (Bag fumbling)
I've been on my ass for some green (Ass for some green)
All these niggas rats for some cheese
On my knees, I pray to God

[Verse]
You think you can trust me? I can only trust myself
I remember you was mad at me when I needed your hеlp
Someone said your name, I said it doеsn't ring a bell
I got rich off toxic bitches in the bank like, hell yeah
OG kush and track runners, she think she a pack runner
Either real or you fake, no inbetween, that's blasphemous
Finally went up and now I know that there's a catch to it
I just copped a brick and flipped that shit, I got my cash through it

Lookin' up to me could 'cause an issue ('Cause an issue)
I got cash and hella gas, like what's the issue? Ayy (What's the issue?)
Way too many hoes, I don't know if I miss you, ayy
Can't let pretty ho get makeup on my fit, ooh, ayy
And I put my ho in Raf Simons jeans (Raf Simons jeans)
I just took his ho 'cause he was bag fumbling (Bag fumbling)
Bag fu—
I've been on my ass for some green (Ass for some green)
All these—
All these rats for some cheese
On my knees, I pray to GodEmbed
