5 ContributorsMelatonin Lyrics[Chorus: jaydes]
I need melatonin, baby, I can't sleep, yeah
In that hallway with some G-Star on my jeans, yeah, yeah
Why your bitch givin' side eyes?
He want that beef we give him Five Guys, he got it
Keep that stick, uh-huh, If he wanna talk on my name
Get your racks up lil' bro, stop being all on my dick for the fame
I need the money, your bitch is in love with me
Feel like Porziņģis, when I'm in the paint
If shawty, huh, yeah, if shawty bad I'll follow on my main
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: jaydes]
I'm with yo' bitch and she bad for what
She tellin' me, “Are you bad for her?”
You was countin' all these racks for real
If I wasn't in my bag, but in your situation I would be mad for real
Now I always keep that mac, always keep that strap, likе I was a—
(Beal)
Uh, how long we go now?
We goin' up, all my niggas at shows now
Talking to gang lеave yo' ass in the showdown
Stop fuckin' with me, got nothin' to hold now
Stop fuckin' with me, these women some ho's now
I feel like Kobe I come with a, yeah
Not gonna lie that shit move like a— (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

But that's really what it was
You really a ho ass bitch, you belong in the dirt (Yeah, the dirt)
Yeah, I just told you I love you but you forgot about my words
