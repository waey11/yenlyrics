5 Contributorsâ€‹hate me Love me Lyrics[Chorus]
Between your walls you can hear my voice
You're tired of me
You're tired of the noise

[Verse]
Why are you crying, shawty?
You said it's my fault
You probably hate me now
You probably hate me now

[Chorus]
Between your walls you can hear my voice
You're tired of me
You're tired of the noise
I'd love to be out of the walls
I make everything terrible
You're saying that you hate me now
I make everything terrible
You're saying that you hate me nowYou might also like3Embed
