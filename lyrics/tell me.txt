You have no heart
Hoodrixh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Big guap, bank account fat, lookin' healthy
Making money, what’s new? Baby, tell me
Back to New York 'cause it got colder, hit my nigga Danny
Movin' fast, TSA can’t smell me
Are we on the same page? Baby, tell me what's changed
Are we on the same page? Baby, tell me what's changed

[Verse]
Only sign that paper if it's more than a mill' 'cause I'm coolin'
Just because I smile at you, we not cool, man
Same niggas hatin’, hoes fanned out at the function
That’s funny to me, sorry that your soulmate droolin'
Watch your tone in my DM’s and you won't get finessed
Gotta watch myself, my fans watching me too
Fuck your text back, I don't need you, ho, I've been runnin’ up

[Chorus]
Big guap, bank account fat, lookin' healthy
Making money, what's new? Baby, tell me
Back to New York 'cause it got colder, hit my nigga Danny
Movin' fast, TSA can't smell me
Are we on the same page? Baby, tell me what's changed
Are we on the same page? Baby, tell me what's changed
