(Keyblade!) Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(You have no heart!)

[Chorus]
Ay, walk in this bitch with a limp
Talk, he get put on a list
Swipin' these cards, you ain't rich
[?], bitch, I know you in pain, 'cause your girlfriend just blew me a kiss
Jugg up the spot, 'cause you talkin, and log off, talkin' and throwin' a fit
You got jugged, you say you a jugg star, then this choppa won't show love
I'm the real jugg star, yeah, the one who fucked you up
[?]
You out here just chasin' hoes, I'm chasin' all my funds
Lil' bro, you a scrub
If I pull up to your block, you better fuckin' run (fye, fye, fye, fye)
And she fuckin' with me 'causе she know I'm number one
And I pull up to your crib, I fuck your bitch, and thеn I'm done (then I'm done)
