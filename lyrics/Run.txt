[Verse 1]
Lil bro gon' get jugged, put that on the bible
I don't give no fuck about yo' lil' title
That bitch want the clout, this shit is not buyable
I need the big pockets, 'cause my money won't fit

[Chorus]
Big Glock, we gon' get that boy lit
Been him, put that shit on my kids
Been him, walk around wit' a stick
Me and twin we be hittin' them blicks
Talk down, he get hit wit' a blick
I'm 'bout to blow a lil' bag on a fit
She wanna fuck, she don't know my name
She still wanna take a flick

And yo' shawty showin' love
When I did that shit
She tryna ride wit' the plug
I don't got no time for you, bitch
Ha, I fеll in love wit' the drugs
Pre-rolls gеt me lit
And yo' shawty say "What's up?"
'Cause she see my wrist
