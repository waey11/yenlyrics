(Hey Glumboy)

[Chorus]
Throw some money all up on the floor
You was flexin' on me, so I had to settle score
Like this shit was Fall Guys I’m runnin' for it
I’m already in my bag, I just wanted more
Shawty, wanna fuck with the team, but she fell off (Oh)
She said, "Ayo, why’d you unfollow? You a sell out"
Started making money, and they wanna be my friend now
You gon' reap what you sow, I'ma act like I don’t know you
Shawty wanna fuck with the team, but she fell off (Oh)
She said, "Ayo, why’d you unfollow? You a sell out"
Started making money and they wanna be my friend now
You gon' reap what you sow, I'ma act like I don’t know you

[Verse]
I gave you the sauce, like a preacher
She said, "I don’t learn"
I said, "Duh, I’m the teacher"
I can’t even walk without my chain on my tee shirt
ADHD meds just got me posted on bleachers
Shawty said she love me but not lovin' me in public
So you know I had to deal with her, I can fuck on someone other
He went from talkin shit, to crying runnin' to his mother
That’s just how it goes you always gon' show your true colors
You might also like[Chorus]
Throw some money all up on the floor
You was flexin' on me, so I had to settle score
Like this shit was Fall Guys I’m runnin' for it
I’m already in my bag, I just wanted more
Shawty, wanna fuck with the team, but she fell off (Oh)
She said, "Ayo, why’d you unfollow? You a sell out"
Started making money, and they wanna be my friend now
You gon' reap what you sow, I'ma act like I don’t know you
Shawty wanna fuck with the team, but she fell off (Oh)
She said, "Ayo, why’d you unfollow? You a sell out"
Started making money and they wanna be my friend now
You gon' reap what you sow, I'ma act like I don’t know you (Like I don't know you)

[Outro]
Like I don't know you, ooh, uh
(You have no heart)Embed
