1 ContributorPictures (snippet) Lyrics*Verse*
B*tches like you know I fold
B*tch gon ride with money and still buy it from the store
Pictures get me paranoid, still buying all these clothes
I got issues with ho's
I can't take no pictures with you
So I love, they all my b*tches dawg, cannot kick it with you-You might also likeEmbed
