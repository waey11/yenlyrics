Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging
I feel there's nothing for me here and I’m trying to get out
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?

[Verse]
I fell into your void, a feeling I can't shake
Do you want me okay?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?

[Chorus]
Imagine how I felt when you left me there hanging
I feel there's nothing for me here and I’m trying to get out
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insanе?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
Imagine how I fеlt when you left me there hanging
I feel there's nothing for me here and I’m trying to get out
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your point
Do you want me insane?
I don’t see your pointYou might also likeEmbed
