2 ContributorsOne Lyrics[Chorus]
All y'all niggas scared
And afraid to run my ones
Act retarded on yo' Instagram and you get jugged (Evvls)
Dressin' all in black 'cause it's matchin' wit' my lungs
And I'm smokin' gas, like it's comin' from a skunk

[Verse]
I might just hop in a wraith
Sissy nigga don't want fight
I got yo' bitch in my face
She tryna go to my place
I can't fuck wit' all these hoes
Light this spliff up wit' a stove
Shawty fuckin' wit' my clothes
She asked for my horoscope
She watch how I switch the flow
Almost like right now
It's my time now (You have no heart!)
Makin' money, signed out
She think I'm fine now
'Cause I'm makin' dimes now
Don't let me find out
You was wastin' time, yeah

[Chorus]
All y'all niggas scared
And afraid to run my ones
Act retarded on yo' Instagram and you get jugged
Dressin' all in black 'cause it's matchin' wit' my lungs
And I'm smokin' gas, like it's comin' from a skunk
You might also likeAll y'all niggas scared
And afraid to run my ones
Act retarded on yo' Instagram and you get jugged
Dressin' all in black 'cause it's matchin' wit' my lungs
And I'm smokin' gas, like it's comin' from a skunk

[Verse]
I might just hop in a wraith
Sissy nigga don't want fight
I got yo' bitch in my face
She tryna go to my place
I can't fuck wit' all these hoes
