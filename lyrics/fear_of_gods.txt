Woah, yeah

Yeah I’m smoking this blunt in front of his house
Locked up though I ain’t get no cell
When I was locked up I ain’t get no cell for real
N- try to rat me out boy can’t be real yeah

Red dot on this muzzle gold crown 
Pussy ass n- running from me now

Like when I up it if you get in the way imma kill you, yeah

Woah, yeah

Yeah I’m smoking this blunt it’s fly as hell
Locked up though I ain’t get no cell
When I was locked up I ain’t get no cell for real
