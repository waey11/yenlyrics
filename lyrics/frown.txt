Hell, hell, yea- yeah
Help, help, uh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Half of me)
Oooh-ah, oooh-ah
Oooh-ah, oooh-ah
Yeah

[Bridge]
Shiver down my spine
Now I can't stand up (Now I get high)
I get high (Is it something I did?)
Is it something I did (Justify what I did)
Dance to my ideas (Dance to my ideas)
Dance to my ideas (Just to my ideas)
(Could've said that about my deals)

[Verse]
Diamond blunts
I'mma keep on rolling to they burn out
(Rolling to they burn out)
I fuck up the percs until I cause another blackout

I throw my pain away now (throw my pain away now)
I throw my pain away
I stuff my pain away to the grimiest shit
And I turn away from watching you fade away
Why am I made this way?
