3 ContributorsJealous Lyrics[Chorus]
All these other hoes is jealous of you
All these other hoes is jealous of you
All these other hoes is jealous of you, aye
Yeah, these other hoes is jealous of you
Come my way if you got something to tell me
Tell my lil' dogs, they tight cause they envy
Crocodile tears and she wish she never met me
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Is you with me right or wrong?
Good gas, smoking strong
Bitch, you know what I want

[Verse]
I had some niggas that died to that shit, man
I know that this shit get real
Hoes tryna act real, niggas tryna act trill
Live by that shit, you gon' die by that glick
I know some niggas that drill, yeah
I'm bout to touch me a mil, yeah
She tryna stack up and chill
This Rick on me, drop me a bag
This your bitch, nigga? Oh, my bad
Can't really tell from the back like that
She ainâ€™t even know I was on the map like that

All these other hoes is jealous of you
All these other hoes is jealous of you
All these other hoes is jealous of you, aye
Yeah, these other hoes is jealous of you
Come my way if you got something to tell me
Tell my lil' dogs, they tight cause they envy
Crocodile tears and she wish she never met me
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Is you with me right or wrong?
Good gas, smoking strong
Bitch, you know what I wantEmbed
