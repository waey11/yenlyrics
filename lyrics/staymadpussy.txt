And yo shawty showin love when I step up in the club
Scammed that boy off of dough
Got a bag full of drugs
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Plug)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah (You have no heart)
Ay, yeah (Plug)

[Verse]
I walk in this bitch, I am the man
I know shawty only want me for bands
I'm whippin a foreign I'm whipping a benz
Glock on my waist, Glock on my pants
Throwing these touchdowns, you in the stands
Bitch I got money, y'all don't understand
You niggas my sons, you niggas my fans
Just copped a pint, copped me gram, wassup
Wassup, wassup
I'm 15 countin buck
Your music is trash, sucks
In my bag, don't give a fuck
And your shawty showing love, when I step up in the club
Scammed that boy off of dough
Got a bag full of drugs
Scam on the web, I'm touring
'Bout to just clutch on my 40
You not my woadie
I'm posted up wit yo shorty
I told that bitch to stop flirting
I put it on God
Can't just imagine your shawty come close
I think I'm a magnet for all of these hoes
Studying me and copy my flows
I am a fiend when it comes to the O's
Stay mad while I'm up, stay mad when I'm up
You depressed, you outta luck
Your bitch in my DM's, she wanna fuck
Down bad and upset
I'm makin money now you wanna be friends
You a bitch nigga, scared to run hands
Shoutout to dro, that nigga the ma- (Plugg)You might also likeEmbed
