(You're pissing me off again Jaydes, because, you don’t wanna answer my fucking calls and my fucking texts like I ain't do shit to you and you still don't wanna fucking answer my calls and texts, and it’s pissing me off)
(This is a Jaydes exclusive bitch)
(Fuck is you talkin' 'bout, you pussy ass nigga)
(Uh, ha)
(You have no heart)

[Chorus]
Ha, I be posted up with Codeine (Codeine)
I hit the blunt 'til I OD (Bih, okay)
I'm like, "Why these bitches know me?" (Bih, okay)
You a trap nigga? Show me (Okay)
You not totin' no 40 ("phew-phew-phew")

[Verse]
When I'm done jugging, I got on these beats
With my hand on my mouse and the keys in my head
You not the gang boy, fuck do you claim boy?
Rather be dead than get caught with the feds
Not talkin' BMO, this shit not a game boy
You make a wrong move, damn, he dead
Niggas get scared to go outside
Pints full of blood, it’s a whole lotta red

[Chorus]
Ha, I be posted up with Codeine (Codeine)
I hit the blunt ’til I OD (Bih, okay)
I'm like, "Why these bitches know me?" (Bih, okay)
You a trap nigga? Show me (Okay)
You not totin’ no 40 ("phew-phew-phew")
You a trap nigga? Show me (Okay)
You not totin' no 40 (Bih)
