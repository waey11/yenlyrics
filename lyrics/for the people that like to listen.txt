Patience, skinny nigga dark in extra conversation
If you look up in his eyes, it's probably vacant
It make sense, he was lost up in his mind, he can't take it, uh
Started makin' a lil' money, got a face lift, I'm playin'
Who should I been puttin' my trust in?
The whole time it's a face up in the mirror, it was me
I think I'm ready for niggas, think it's debatable
I been gettin' too rich now my music not relatable like Drake said
If you not fuckin' with jaydes, you might as well just play dead, uh
You play on easy mode, you don't care what they said, huh?

[Bridge]
Magnetize that to yourself and then that's gon' take place

[Verse 2]
I'm too geeked, I'm on the sidewalk feelin' sideways (You have no heart)
Tick tock, time been movin' my way, it's my day, uh
Mona Lisa, pretty face and waist I'm craving
Teach my ho a little bit 'bout savings, her money fi— (You have no heart)
I'm too geeked, I'm on the sidewalk feelin' sideways
