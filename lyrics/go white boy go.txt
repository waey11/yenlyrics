Bloody nose, think I messed up
I’m the hero, you look like an extra
You took an L when you were next up
I took a dub, onto the next one
My signal's lagging out, I think I lost connection
With all my bros, I really miss them
I wrung my heart, they didn't listen
They only really wanted me for all the chicken
Starin' at my shoes, like, "Damn, that's tough"
Guess I wasn't made for this stuff
Breakin' in, was gettin' fuckin' rough
Now I run away from what I've become
Gotta pull her in by my side
Staring into your crystal eyes
You're lookin' at me like I might diе
But I'm just lookin' onto being alive

[Verse 2]
Like, "Go, go, go", I lost sеnse of direction
I blow, blow off every bitch in my mentions
It's low, low, low, at the ground where we steppin'
Don't know, know, know where the fuck that I'm chasin' next
I lose my body, I'm just a neck and a head
So you better show me some respect
And all these chasers are on my jock for the day
When I just wanna really wanna get in bed
You might also like[Outro]
That's the end of the song
Yeah, yeahEmbed
