I see why all these niggas so late
I see why all these niggas so late
Na na na na
Na na na na (You have no heart)
Na na na na
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
These lil' hoes on my dick, yeah
Draculea on my dick, yeah
Real diva with that thick, yeah
Goth bitch on my Xans
How come you don't got no man?
Baby, let me be your man?
When you leave, I'm not your man
She off the coke, I sip lean
Smoke on my diamonds, they dance
She wanna go buy CELINE
Drop me that neck, I'm a fiend
Give me that neck, I need blood
This bitch wan' lick on the bean
This bitch wan' lick on my gun
My new shit got a red beam

[Bridge]
I don't talk nigga I'm just servin' the trap (Yeah)
Dumb lil' bitch sat there playin' with my strap (Yeah, yeah)
Pinks on me, I stay with a pack

I would be mad if I did all that cap, huh, yeah (Bleh)
I might do something heinous
All black like Darth Vader
Think I need a Leia just so I could lay up
I be feeling insane 'cause I pull up and want brains, yeah
Feel this in my veins
Me and you is not the same, lil' bro, ayy, yeah
Me and you is not the same, lil' bro, yeah
Me and you is not the same, lil' bro (Huh, huh)
Me and you is not the same, bro
It’s OK though
You just a lil' flame, dawg
I just get this bankroll
You just be OK, dawg
These niggas just be tryna bite my shit
Niggas be on my dick bitin' my shit

[Outro]
Gang gon' eat (Yeah, huh)
Whole clique gon' eat (Yeah, yeah)
