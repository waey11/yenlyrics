Hoodrich
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh, hey

[Chorus]
She know she fuck wit' a bag
I know that she like the cash too
Spending time wit' the racks
I know that she like the cash too
All these bitches want me
You gettin' close, wouldn't put it past you

(You pissin' me off again jaydes)
(Because you don't wanna answer my fuckin' texts)

[Verse]
She needa chill that shit
I like you better when I'm off the gas
I swear to god I can't feel you bitch
I'm in this bitch wit' multiple hoes
But I really know it's still you bitch
Yeah, you always be on that bullshit
Yeah, don't know why I'm in love wit' you, I'm clueless
Ima thug it out until I'm coolin'
You said you in love with me, let's do it
(You said you in love, you got me foolish)
