[Verse]
Shawty kinda bad but she tweaking (Bad)
Yeah I think I want her for the weekend (For the weekend)
Shawty heard me thinking, I’m dreaming (Dreaming)
I might have to claim her this season (This season)
She's in love with the racks thats why she didn’t like you (Nah)
575 like the lines of a haiku
Wait, listen to that bar, its cold like an ice cube (Yeah)
You said pull up to your crib, don’t know if I got time to (Yeah)
Uh yeah, yeah
Ay, yeah, yeah
Ay, yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty said she got a boyfriend, I don’t really care
You the one, tiny waist, prеtty face, wavy hair
My bitch goin crazy, ion care what she wеars
[?] but they nothing to compare
Yeah, nothing to compare
Yeah, they nothing to compare
Yeah, they nothing to compare
Yeah, hell yeah
