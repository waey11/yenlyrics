7 ContributorsAlone Lyrics[Intro]
I came in this bitch alone yuh
Yuh yuh yuh yuh aye

[Chorus]
I came in this bitch alone, you know
Lurking in dark on my own

[Verse]
It really been me and this blade for the longest
Make a wrong move, swear to god that's a soul
I look at your eyes when your struggling
Nigga really fucking dying but they cover it
Niggas can't kill me that's their punishment
Dumb bitch think she can ruin mi vida
It been fuck them, more in my Visa
Boofing good pack zip full of reefer
Kick out of that sorry ass school (Fuck the teachers)

Foreign baby wanna eat me up, yuh i need that
Don't get stuck on the word, I ain't mean that bae
Really posted up with my birds, yuh I mean that bae
Mama said im getting colder and i see that, baе

[Chorus]
I came in this bitch alone, you know
I came in this bitch alonе, lurking in the dark on my mothafuckin ownYou might also likeEmbed
