3 Contributors​salad days Lyrics[Verse 1]
She was my retribution
The body's decomposing
She scratched me on my shoulder
But I told her we're fine
Everything's so pointless
Everyone's a loser
You need to hear it
When you're in need of your own life
[Verse 2]
My retribution's gone, she's just another blonde
Her Cold and lifeless body, was supposed to move on
Maybe I'm just joking, but maybe I'm not kidding
I'd love to play pretend, but all the kidding me is gone
Oh, there's no sirens
Nobody's gonna hеar it when you scream
Oh, it's so quietYou might also likeEmbed
