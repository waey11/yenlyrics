2 Contributors(miss my) headache Lyrics[Verse]
(You have no heart!)
When you look in my eyes, what do you believe?
Searching through all the lies, only you can see
Moving through all my pride, to what's true to me
Wanna move all the (?), this is new to me

[Chorus]
Damn, I miss my headache
Damn, I miss my headache
(Damn, I miss my headache)
(Miss my, miss my headache)You might also likeEmbed
