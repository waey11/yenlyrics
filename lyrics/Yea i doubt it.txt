4 ContributorsYea i doubt it Lyrics{Verse}
I hated seeing you away
I think about it everyday
Would it kill you to see it my way this time
I promise everything won't change

[Chorus]
I promise everything's okay
Left at it maybe i'll be fine
I promise everything's okay
Left at it maybe i'll be fine

[Verse]
But you haunt me through the parallel
And you gotta trust in me as well
But I doubt it (but I doubt it)
But I doubt it

[Chorus]
I promise everything's okay
Left at it maybe i'll be fine
I promise everything's okay
Left at it maybe i'll be fineYou might also likeEmbed
