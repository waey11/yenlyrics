19 Contributors​highschool Lyrics[Intro]
(Hey, Glumboy)
(Money keeps goin' up)
(You have no heart)
(Damn it, Luna)

[Verse 1]
I've been kicking shit like it was soccer
Bitch, I knew you would pull up here when I made it, what a shocker
Please don't step on my Balenciagas
Step up in a function, you gon' think that I'm a model

[Chorus]
Fifteen but my bands not up on no high school shit
Sorry I get bored and I say bye too quick
I can't worry 'bout commitment, got a life to live
Don't worry 'bout yo wifey, yeah she's in my crib
Fifteen but my bands not up on no high school shit
Sorry I get bored and I say bye too quick
I can't worry 'bout commitment, got a life to live
Don't worry 'bout yo wifey, yeah she's in my crib

[Verse 2]
Pour up codeine in my soda
When I blow up I'll act like I don't know ya
Makin' all this money, what's thе point of me not showing?
And my clique goin' up, yeah wе glowin' right now
Shawty wanna fuck, so I told her "Pipe down"
And the money kept on countin' you could tell by the sound
Throw some money on the floor, while you niggas throwin' fits
Makin' guala while your ego gettin' damaged
You might also like[Chorus]
Fifteen but my bands not up on no high school shit
Sorry I get bored and I say bye too quick
I can't worry 'bout commitment, got a life to live
Don't worry 'bout yo wifey, yeah she's in my crib
Fifteen but my bands not up on no high school shit
Sorry I get bored and I say bye too quick
I can't worry 'bout commitment, got a life to live
Don't worry 'bout yo wifey, yeah, she's in my crib1Embed
