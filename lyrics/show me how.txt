Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo (Uh, uhh)

[Verse 1]
Tell me how you care
Tell me how it went left before
Show me how you smile
Tell me why your hands are so cold

[Chorus]
(Show me how)
I'm turning around
I'm having visions of you
Then I understand
The friend I'm dreaming of is far away
But I'm here
I'm here

[Verse 2]
Show me how you're proud
Tell me how you reach the moon
My thoughts err away tonight
My heart fell to love again
You might also like[Chorus]
(Show me how)
I'm turning around
I'm having visions of you
Then I understand
The friend I'm dreaming of is far away
And doesn't feel my love
But I do
I doEmbed
