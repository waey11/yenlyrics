"Like every time you start talking I think to myself who the fuck does this girl think she is?”
No-No funny shit
"You are so fucking boring!"

[Verse]
Something’s wrong
Something’s wrong
Something’s wrong
Your face doesn’t match you at all
But there's nothing you could do at all
About the voices you heard through your wall
My consequences never threw me off
I hope you cry when I’m not around
I hope you cry when I’m not around
I hope you cry when I’m not around

[Outro]
But there’s nothing you could do at all
About the voices you heard through your wall
My consequences never threw me off
I hope you cry when I’m not around
I hope you cry when I’m not around
I hope you cry when I’m not around
I hope you cry when I’m not aroundYou might also likeEmbed
