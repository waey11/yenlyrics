2 Contributorsâ€‹sick (2024) Lyrics[Verse 1: mandy]
Going through the motions makes me feel sick
I'm stuck away, and you're tired of it
I savor her turned lips singing away
I'm stuck apart and I'm miserable

[Verse 2: wifiskeleton]
You can do what you want to, I don't care
Hey, hey, hey
You can find me in the same damn place as always
If you were packing up my bags
Don't for long 'cause I'll come back
