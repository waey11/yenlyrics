2 ContributorsMe Lyrics(pew pew pew)
(NOVAGANG)
(you have no heart)

[Chorus]
I'ma start this lil bitch, We gon' come in backflips
And yo bitty gon' top me, she like ridin' on her knees
And I'm trappin' out my school, yeah I'm pushin' all this tree
And yo bitch say that she want me cause she see me on tv (woah)
And yo bitch, she gettin' naked
How yo talkin like you up but didn't make shit
And they talkin behind my back, I don't got say in it
Bitch I'm on my grind, If you not talkin bout money then I'm hanging up

[Verse]
You's a bitch on my soul
Walkin wit' a wrist, lookin at you "what are those?" (WHAT ARE THOSE!)
And I'm callin from the phone that I stole
And my gang is not my wallet cause my mans never fold  (ohh)
I don't give a fuck about your feelings  (nope. nope.)
Going up and my bands they be healin'
I got xannies, I got perkies, nigga that's just what I'm dealing
She think I'm pretty so my swag is what they stealin'

[Chorus]
I'ma start this lil bitch, We gon' come in backflips
And yo bitty gon' top me, she like ridin' on her knees
And I'm trappin' out my school, yeah I'm pushin' all this tree
And yo bitch say that she want me cause she see me on tv (woah)
And yo bitch, she gettin' naked
How yo talkin like you up but didn't make shit
And they talkin behind my back, I don't got say in it
Bitch I'm on my grind, If you not talkin bout money then I'm hanging upYou might also likeEmbed
