Ooooooooo
My feet feel cold when I bring this one thing up

[Chorus]
It gets worse, yeah I know it hurts
Can you swallow your feelings one more time
Cut me up until my wrist burns
Can you swallow your feeling one more time
Anything to pass the time
I'm so tired of it all
I’m a hoax and you see why
I won't do this without you

[Bridge]
Ooooooo
Oooooo
I won't do this without you
I won’t
I won't
I won't
Ooooooo
Oooooo (Goth Trauma Bonding Experience)

[Chorus]
It gets worse yeah I know it hurts
Can you swallow your feelings one more time (Goth Trauma Bonding)
Cut me up until my wrist burns
Can you swallow your feeling one more time
Anything to pass the time
I'm so tired of it all
I'm a hoax and you see why
I won't do this without you
