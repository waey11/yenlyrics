(You have no heart)
Okay

[Chorus]
Yeah, do any mission, no GTA
Just hit a jug with that bpm
She hit me up, past the eta
[?], shit is to easy yeah
I'm off the block bitch, I'm wheezin'
Imma fuck, all of your bitches for no reason
She want a nigga telling shawty fiendin'
In the west side, shawty wanna be my LA, bitch
She gon' pull up with that Mag-10
Well fuck nigga, gon' switch up
Your bitch fuck with shiny things, she compliment my wrist
When I fuck up on your women, I promise that she won't miss you
