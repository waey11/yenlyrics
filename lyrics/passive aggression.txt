Maybe acting passive
Yo, Silo killed this shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
You have no heart!

[Chorus: jaydes]
Maybe acting passive but, I really keep a semi on me
Guess it's always snowin' hella white hoes, I got plenty on me
If I'm feeling generous, I'll take her to a Benibachi
Her nigga watching, too bad that he won't do shit
I'm making money too quick for me
I know he sick, watching me just take his bitch from him
I don't wanna sound like niggas up on TikTok
But your bitch pushing my agenda
I get my money from there and I spend ​it
That's not your car nigga, that's a rental
Why your hoe want me ovеr you?
Bitch don't make me choose
You got еverything to lose, and I'm just countin' up my blues
Fuck your bitch and gave her back, the world that we live in is cruel
Cause I'm the shit man, living proof

[Verse 1: Yung Fazo]
I'm like by the way
I'm like "Baby can we fuck? I wanna fuck today"
I've been getting to the bands, yeah, since like yesterday, ha
How the fuck they hate on me? I'm the goat, that's no debate
I got Wok up in my cup cause the drugs, they heal my pain
I'm gon' slide, to your crib
And this 5, get you spilt
All these haters, just be on my dick
'Boutta half your ass, like a Twix
Do the dash then, jump in the whip
I'ma crash mama, she gon' flip

She want to fuck on the first day, ha
I'm getting money, no birthday
I haven't changed since the first day out (Even on my fucking worst days)
Hah, posted with that Draco
With the angels, see the halo
They hating on my nigga, Fazo
They never wanna show they face though

[Chorus: jaydes]
Maybe acting passive but, I really keep a semi on me
Guess it's always snowin' hella white hoes, I got plenty on me
If I'm feeling generous, I'll take her to a Benibachi
Her nigga watching, too bad that he won't do shit
I'm making money too quick for me
I know he sick, watching me just take his bitch from him
I don't wanna sound like niggas up on TikTok
But your bitch pushing my agenda
I get my money from there and I spend ​it
That's not your car nigga, that's a rental
Why your hoe want me over you?
Bitch don't make me choose
You got everything to lose, and I'm just countin' up my blues
Fuck your bitch and gave her back, the world that we live in is cruel
Cause I'm the shit man, living proofEmbed
