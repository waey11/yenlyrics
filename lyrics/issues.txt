4 Contributors​issues Lyrics[Intro]
(you have no heart)
Wit' these bad bitches since yesterday
Did my shit like 'yes I did'
I might go and fuck that bitch
Act like I don't know who she is
It's all jokes until that toolie hit
Walk in that bitch, they point and stare
Close your mouth, stop drooling bitch (yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
Wit' these bad bitches since yesterday
Did my shit like 'yes I did'
I might go and fuck that bitch
Act like I don't know who she is
It's all jokes until that toolie hit
Walk in that bitch, they point and stare
Close your mouth, stop drooling bitch (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I wish I gave a fuck 'bout your issues
I wish I gave a fuck 'bout your issues
